yes but you are limited in your options  some statesparties spent huge amounts of money to keep competitors off the ballots and restrict your choice to someone who has been chosen for you to choose from 
for the general  it depends on where you live if you live in a solidly republican or solidly democrat state  then it really doesn't but those that live in  battleground  states where neither party has dominance  their votes matter quite a bit  but primaries for the parties  yes  your vote does matter 
this is perhaps a bit beyond the scope of the sub  but let's see one of the theories i like best says that these other universes  dimensions  whatever you call them  occupy the same points in space that ours does they just exist at a different point in time kind of like how you and i exist at the same point in time  but not the same spacial location so an alternate you would be sitting right where you are  but at a point in time you've already left or haven't yet arrived at
for any such number where there are units of measurement involved  like the speed of light  it's because the units are not derived from that phenomenon humans defined miles  kilometers  seconds  minutes  etc  first then we used them to describe the speed of light it's like measuring a random tree in the forest what are the chances it ll be precisely 30 meters tall  as for pi  which is a pure mathematical ratio  there s no explanation it just is what it is 
i'm actually kind of upset that c  speed of light is not exactly 300000000 ms  since 1983  the metre has been officially defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1299792458 of a second damn  it's almost recursive 

pi is a constant that is determined purely by geometry if you measure distances using the usual  shortest straight line  method in the plane  your circles will involve pi  numbers like the speed of light and gravitational constant depend on your choice of unit  they are not  dimensionless  constants   you can make them integers by choosing particular units  in the same way that you can make the 169 miles to a friend s house an integer by simply saying it's  1 friendistance   atomic weight is  for most elements  an average of the weights of several different isotopes an average  at random proportions  is very unlikely to be an integer in the first place 
there are systems of measurement units where the universal constants are round numbers just has not caught on in normal use https  enwikipediaorgwikinatural_units  systems_of_natural_units
the speed of light  atomic weight  and the gravitational constant are based on units that we invented  so if they were a round number  it would just be a coincidence  pi  on the other hand is a constant without a unit  being a ration between two things   explaining why pi is the number it is relies on some funky math that completely shows exactly why the ratio between the circumference of a circle and its diameter couldn't be anything other than 314159  but the the calculation doesn't give some grand  meaning  that is satisfying to the average person 
for me  i can say that i do  dream  every time and it's usually just as if life had kept on without the faint like i'm continuing what i was doing the absolute worst part of it  though  is the waking up that to me is far scarier than fainting itself my brain coming out of dream mode where everything had been fine to hearing people  if i'm not alone  saying my name over and over in an attempt to pull me out of it only i can't respond yet i can't open my eyes no matter how hard i try i just have to wait it out in the black  even though i've become fully aware of my surroundings 
i had 34 fainting spells over the last few years i can concur that it does suck  in general i feel really nauseous about 3 minutes before and sometimes get tinnitus in one ear also i get overheated and sweaty  one time i was on a train and made it off the train only to faint on the concrete platform i actually don't  remember anything between getting off the train and waking up on the ground  had to get 5 stitches in my chin and bruised a rib  another time i was at a sit down show  my wife and friends held me up so i wouldn  t collapse on the row in front  but being held upright caused my brain to lose oxygen and my body reacted by vomiting everywhere  so yeah  it really sucks the fainting itself is dangerous in that you just go down and can really hurt yourself  and the leadup is highly unpleasant 
there are a lot of reasons people faint  if you get hit hard enough  your brain may knock against the inside your skull and may shut down as a defense mechanism  you may have low blood pressure  which will caused oxygen supply to lower to the brain your brain responds by shutting down  you may be hyperventiliating  which also interferes with oxygen to the brain  what your brain does  is basically knocks you out so that you will become horizontal this will make it easier for your heart to pump oxygen to the brain fainting is  in this respect  a survival reflex  as for what it's like  it sucks i get vasovagal syncope from time to time  though now i know what triggers it  anxiety attacks  and how to combat them directly so it doesn't happen anymore  i have no perception of the passing out  when i wake up  it's like everything is fuzzy and slow and really far away i am totally disoriented   to share an embarassing story  the first time it happened to me  i was on the toilet i was going through some weight loss  and had overdone it at the gym for a week and didn't eat enough i was at like 1800 calories and really should have been eating more like 2800 or more  so  on the toilet got dizzy got a stomache ache woke up totally freaking out and thinking i was gon na die  horrible  but  i saw a doctor  it happened again  and we talked about what was going on and how to prevent it 

for the customer  security  the chip is somewhat harder to counterfeit  for issuer  the chip carries a lot more of your personal data that can be tracked and sold 
i ve lost conciseness a few times i can tell when it's going to happen and can usually prevent it or mitigate it  typically is just when i'm getting blood drawn   usually light headed  with a double helping of dizzy the worst if when i'm so far gone i can't communicate anymore happened once when i was at the doctor s office getting an ingrown toenail removed  tried to say i didn't feel well  but i couldn't physically get anything to come out was told when i passed out i went into convulsions  each time when i started to come to  i was dreaming very disorientating to wake up because for a few seconds i have no idea where i am or why the fuck i'm on the floor then my memory comes back and is just embarrassing 
i ve never fainted before is there any changes in blood pressure or brain activity or anything like that  and do people dream when they faint like if they were just sleeping 
also  why are they so slow in comparison to regular swipe readers 
the mass migration is because the us congress passed a law that both required card companies to issue chipped cards  and holds merchants responsible if a stolen card is used in their store and it's swiped instead of put in the machine for the chip to be read  the current chip implementation  without a pin to back it up  is only useful in making it harder for a thief to use a cloned card  because they can still use it online  and they can still use the original chipped card if it is in their possession  which i feel is not worth the aggravation of having to deal with temperamental chip readers that can't read a card if it's even the tiniest bit dirty  last night  my card actually crashed the pos terminal  i can't imagine that this could even possibly happen with a normal swipe card 
i ve fainted a fair amount of times it suuuuuuucks your body just shuts off only takes a few seconds but it feels like an eternity hearing goes  vision goes  then bam i've never dreamt  but i've never been out for more than a few seconds it really is horrible 
addressing data packets have various ways of addressing data  your 8023  ethernet cat 5 cable  uses 48bit addressing so each device on your lan has a unique address for the frame header your appliancesdevices then establish their own ip address via static  preassigned  or dynamic  like dhcp  means  phones have their own addressing schemes no doubt but i'm not versed in that specifically 
bills are when adults pay for things they used in the past month electricity has a bill because the electric company is asking you to pay for all the electricity you used all at once instead of everytime you turn on the lights  as far as other responsibilities people get jobs to pay for all the things they want to buy they clean and do other tasks to make the things they buy look and work nicely they pay taxes so the government will give them things like roads and schools they go to the store to buy food and other things they want  basically all adult things are methods of making money to buy things and spending money on things they want 
wow i'm 25 and i've had cards for 10 years and they have always had chips  is this new for america  why hasn't it happened sooner when its a better technology 
my 4 year old cousin asked me out of the blue what bills are  and before i answered her question i told her i'd come back to her what i'm really doing is asking you guys how to simplify it in a way that she could understand 
without the chip  any compromised terminal can copy the information on the card this allows for fraudulent payment even while the card holder maintains possession of the card  which means the fraud is often not discovered until much later the chip facilitates the use of encryption  so that the particular information from the card and the processor network received by the terminal are only valid for that specific transactionthe data can still be copied  but can not be used for new transactions and is therefore useless  the  mass migration  is because the credit card networks are now incentivizing merchants in the us to accept the chipif they do not  they bear the cost of fraud  and not the issuer  as with most fraud   so now not only will the issuers benefit from issuing chipenabled cards  but the merchants will want to accept and use those cards as well 
magnet strip is like a barcode anybody can read it because it's just a number if they then also spy your pin they have all your monies  chip is a little computer that knows secrets it can use these secrets to give special answers to questions that are never asked twice  so even if you spy on what the terminal and the card are saying to each other you can only hear a question and a answer to a question when you try to fool the machine that reads the card it will ask a completely different question  and the answer you secretly listened in on is useless only the machine that reads the cards and the computer on the chip in the card know the correct answers to the questions 

there were'nt  all those calls  many people had what was known as  party lines  where a single phone line was shared by multiple homes if you picked up the phone  you could sometimes interrupt someone else s call  and you had to ask them to wrap it up  so you could call  to make a long distance or even international call  you would have to  depending on which era  speak to a long distance or international phone operator first  and have them make the connection for you as a kid  i remember  my parents having to call the international operator and scheduling a time with them to make an international phone call 
 straight  usually means  parallel to the ground   the ground is curved because the earth is a sphere 
planes travel based on an orentation to the earth the pilots try to stay at a level altitude  climbing takes more fuel  and dropping eventually leads you to crash so when they are flying  straight and level   it means at a constant speed at a constant altitude  climbing takes more fuel because of gravity  gravity is pulling the plane down the whole time it is flying so flying straight is actually falling a little bit  enough to match the curvature of the earth 
aircraft mechanic here  going to try to field this one i assume you mean if a plane  flys straight up   why don't they go into outter space its because of bernoulli s principle  or the physics of how an aerofoil acts to passing relative wind as a wing passes through the atmosphere  the wind moves faster over the top then it does over the bottom this creates positive pressure under the wing and negative pressure above it if the wing begins to climb at too step of a climb  or angle of attack  that dynamic between thoses forces end  and you get something called a stall pretty much a flat tire of the aviation world the airflow sperates  or delaminates from the surface of the wing  and poof good bye lift although the us military has developed some impressive hardware  such as the sr71 blackbird  btw it is a beast  look into it   it has only a max ceiling of 85k feet  which is barely scratching troposphere  the lowest part of our atmosphere to break the earths gravitational pull requires thousands of pounds of thrust  the likes of only space shuttles can accomplish  hope this helped  and sorry for any grammer errors  not really  
if they did  they would  but they don't  so they won't  that s some seussinspired wording for the 5yo mind 
my younger sibling asked me this and i don't know how to explain it to them 
planes in the air are still affected by gravity in order for them to stay off the ground  a force has to be applied in the opposite direction of gravity  aka lift   now planes can get lift two ways the common way is using wings as air moves over the wings  the shape pushes most of it down increasing pressure under the wing and decreasing it above you can experience this yourself by sticking your hand out of a car window the second way in some jet powered aircraft  the force of the engine is enough to lift the plane without using wings this works the same way as letting go of the end of a balloon both of these are contingent on having enough air to either power the jet engine  or provide lift under the wings as planes fly higher  the air gets thinner until it is not enough to power the engines or provide enough lift under the wings to get to space  you need a rocket that brings its own air with it to power its engines
there s some truth to these answers  but i don't see a key component  you lips have   huge dilated veins   under the  less keratinized  thin  melaninpoor  skin more translucent skin  and a big reservoir of blood  make our lips red so when your blood is poorly oxygenated  or when you're cold and blood shunts to your core  and away from less vital organs like your lips   your lips get blue 
also  how the hell do i keep them moist  they seem to just dry out quickly 
i ve only just wondered why this is

there is an infinite amount of numbers whole numbers are a specific set of numbers  which is much smaller than the entire set of numbers  despite being infinite as such  it's more likely to be a decimal like 314 continuing than a whole number

because the demand is there  quite simply  it costs a lot of money to hire professors after all  they could make good money outside education  in many cases   so they have to be paid well enough to keep them from leaving for greener pastures and classrooms and all the other facilities that go into a university aren't exactly cheap  so all of that means that the university has to charge at least some number of dollars just to break even and at that number  they still have more applicants than they can take supply and demand forces them  more or less  to raise the cost to attend

it is my understanding that stress causes your body to release chemicals  such as adrenaline and cortisol  that are normally useful in the short term  eg  preparing your body to run away from danger  but can cause damage in the long term  such as creating effects similar to aging  when it comes specifically to wrinkles  those are often created by repeated folding of the skin like how the lines on your hand are caused by the way your skin folds when you move your fingers or shoe leather develops cracks and wrinkles around the area that your show bends when you walk people tend to make faces when they are stressed because of our instinctive use of our faces to communicate our feelings to others  so stress can cause people to make faces that cause the skin to crease such as the creation of worry lines  conversely  there are also what are known as laugh lines  which are caused by the way the skin of your face creases when you smile

modern websites  especially popular ones are not a standalone computer running a webserver they're usually part of a full network of servers  front end web servers that receive a request from users web caches that store commonly requested pages and data databases and file servers for a lot of the back end data  so front end webserver can be programmed to follow this sequence  1 check if page is available in the web cache  use that if possible  2 if web cache is unavailable or slow to respond query database and file server  use that if possible 3 fall back to an error page of  overloaded  or  down for maintenance 
part of it may come from a phenomenon called high place phenomenon http  wwwnbcnewscomhealthbodyoddweirdurgejumpbridgeexplainedf424037 essentially it's this strange pull to desire things we don't actually desire because our body is confused why we are doing something that seems uncomfortable watching crush videos seems gross and wrong to most of us but some people may be triggered to feel like they like the images because of the high place phenomena some scientists think this is where humans get strange and gross desires during sex in general i won't give examples but i'm sure your imagination can think of other gross things people masturbate to  like hentai   it may be just a matter of your brain being confused why you're watching something so it may interpret the stimuli as sexually arousing 
okay lets start with dimensions  yes we live in a universe with three physical dimensions the fourth dimension refers to time  or more specifically  causality  the process in which a transformation or change causes changes another change or transformation within the universe  basically the concept of cause and effect as causality determines the direction in which time flows  the important thing to realize here is that this model is what is defined by the standard model of physics  or our current accepted  interpretation  of physical laws of the universe various other theories such as the multiverse theories  string theory  supersymmetry theory  or super string theory offer varying interpretations of the physical laws which govern our universe now i use the word interpretation not as in that these laws or somehow not concrete or defined  they are definitely defined and established  it is simply how we connect these laws  in regards to the multiple universes  although our current model of physics doesn't account for the existence of multiple universes in a multiverse  the other mentioned theories and models do i would recommend a book called hyperspace by michio kaku which explains multiverses  branes  higher dimensions  as well as many other topics in great depth  though with layman s terms so it is easy for average person to understand

i have been unconscious several different ways and never have i dreamed or anything like that  the time always passed instantaneously  i was knocked the fuck out tobogganing as a kid and it was one moment sledding into a tree and the next lying on the ground sore all over  i passed out giving blood in highschool because i hadn't eaten much or drank any water they tilted me back to get blood back to the brain and your body tries to get as much there as possible so your head gets very hot  it can actually be dangerous so they have fans and shit  overall not very nice and made me very nauseous pretty much the same experience being choked unconscious while training jiu jitsu and my partner squeezed a choke a bit too tight  but that one wasn't as bad and i was only out for like a second  also had a very bad concussion skiing and i didn't go out but i lost memory from about five minutes before and an hour afterwards  apparently a nurse asked me a bunch of questions and i got all of them wrong  like didn't know my name or age  overall most pleasant experience was being sedated for a surgery which was basically like a very deep dreamless sleep and i woke up very well rested  from my understanding all of these area a result of something making your brain shut down  sometimes just partially  because of several different reasons either an impact that forces your mind to basically reset  getting too little oxygen for brain function or a drug putting you out  tl  dr i've been out basically every way possible and each one is pretty much my brain not being able to handle something so it dips 
had the vasovagal syncope reaction happen several times when violently ill the very first time i fought the reaction  which probably made it worse  thought i was dying at home alone  called my mom out of work with the most desperately breathless  i'm dying i need halp  before blacking out and waking up not a minute later completely disoriented i read somewhere that there s a reaction from your blood pressure dropping too rapidly  judging from other comments  i suppose the blood pressure drop results in a similar drop of oxygen to the brain  so it takes a little break 
i go with pain tolerance as a big part of the answer here apparently as a child i used to  sob  if something came  close  to hitting me  like the wind of a cupboard door shutting   fear could be a little bit of societal pressure but probably more communication we cry more when we can't communicate with words  and when we can communicate with words we still have no real gradient of pain  and haven't grown a tolerance to a paper cut  like we do as adults

when you say  clusters  are you more referring to galaxies  as in why don't they continually disperse as the universe is accelerating  if so  then i'll say this we attribute  dark matter  as a force that pulls and keeps things together  like galaxies mathematical calculations reveal dark matter to amount to about 25  of all the mass in the universe  remember  mass has an equivalent energyforce  thanks to einstein   this is in contrast to  dark energy  which we call the force which pushes the universe apart and we attribute as the cause of the exponentially accelerating expansion of spacetime calculations reveal darn energy to amount to about 71  of the mass in the universe  we know these two things exist we call them  dark  because they do not interact in any manner of a directly observable spectrum  and in fact we've yet to deduce a manner in which to measure them directly when you have a feeling something is there  but can not take a picture or measure to account for it  you carefully account for every single other variable that you can  whatever externalities left over which serve to unbalance your mathematical proofs afterward are thus  dark  but nonetheless must exist in some fashion  for instance  we know dark matter  pulling force  exists after a hubble experiment measures the speed at which stars in the milky way move around the galactic core logic says  the stars nearest to the core must be moving around the center at a higher rate if speed than those stars around the edges  as an analogy  hypothetically  imagine a hubcap on a car that has bolts right around the center and more bolts at the very edge of the rim  not very realistic  but moving on   you'd imagine those those bolts right around the center of the rim are spinning at a faster velocity than those on the outside of the rim  moving at the same rpm but around a shorter distance stars in the milky way should follow suit  right    only they didn't all the stars  besides those in the immediate death zone proximity of the super massive black hole at the center of the galaxy  are rotating around at the same speed which  all else held relative  means there must be some external force  dark matter  outside the halo of the milky way which is  tugging  on all of the stars to maintain this equivalent speed crazy  right   we can't put it in a beaker and measure it directly  but we can observe and measure it's influence to some degree  sorry for the long winded response  i hope that this isn't too hard to digest and makes some sense

the candidates seem to think it matters the party nominees are going to end up spending about a billion dollars each trying to get votes they won't spend a lot in my home state because we've voted for the same party for over 30 years  but i still get to have my say in primaries  i also believe that every vote is important in the  long  run my vote won't determine who wins my state this november but every extra vote for the losing candidate is a tiny little message to the winning party that there are still people here who disagree with them every extra tiny vote for the loser makes it a teeny bit more likely that the winners will have to consider paying attention to people like me next time if they want to keep winning 

all your body s cells make extensive use of protein the reason we associate protein with muscle is that s really the only kind of cell we intentionally cultivate if you had a method to  say  grow an extra couple of feet of spinal cord  or an extra liver  you'd need a lot of protein for that  too 
our body has various reflexes to protect our airways that being said  there are 2 reasons for this   the profound choking reflex makes you cough  which in turn increases your secretion of different glands in your head this is for  lubricating  your airways one of those happens to be the gland at our eyes  lacrimal   now normally the secretion of the tear gland drains down thereby further lubricating our oral cavity and not much is left in our eyes in this case however this is different  which leads us to reason 2   the coughing creates pressure in the duct that drains the gland at your eye the secretion is again pushed up and we are left with teary eyes  so tldr  increased secretion because of reflex and pressure pushes secretion  up  again into our eyes  hope others can correct mistakes if they find any 
every point in space is simultaneously expanding away from every other point gravity overcomes that in the local sense  hence why planets and other celestial objects aren't being pulled apart but no matter what point in the universe you're at  it ll look like every other part is moving away from you
below is a link to an image that i think explains this succinctly  figure a and figure b are both representing the same points in universe at different times in figure b  the universe is older and has expanded substantially  take figure b and put it on top of figure a so that any of the red dots on top of the  corresponding  dot in figure a you ll see that no matter which point you do that with  it looks like the universe is racing away from that very point  http  istackimgurcomuoqrkpng

this is something of a fluke in the credit reporting system it is relevant to report someone s status as an authorized user because it shows they have experience using credit cards people who are used to cards are more likely to use them responsibly than those who are new to them however  the particular repayment habits of the cardholder are not relevant in that scenario  though they are nevertheless displayed  even if negative   it's up to each lender to decide what they want to do with that information for the reason you mentioned  some don't consider it very important at all in making lending decisions

sometimes you buy things by handing the other person some money  right  if someone trusts you  they might let you buy something if you just promise to pay them later  a bill is a piece of paper where they write down how much money you promised to pay for that thing  whatever it was they send it to you so that you remember how much money you are supposed to pay 
if they have the gun  they can test that the bullet was fired from that gun the type of ammo  of course  but then also it leaves microscopic marks when it's fired 
in most modern hand guns and rifles  not counting most shotguns  there is a series of grooves inside the gun barrel  known as rifling  that spin the bullet in a spiral that spiral spinning of the bullet helps it travel in a straighter path it also leaves a unique fingerprint of scratches on the bullet as it exits the barrel  every barrel leaves a unique series of scratches on the bullet  either from variation in manufacturing or in wear of the barrel so compare the recovered bullet from the crime scene  and compare it to a suspected gun if the two match  then you have confirmed that bullet came from that gun as far as i know  there is no database of barrel rifle signatures  see also https  enwikipediaorgwikiballistic_fingerprinting
the simple finger prints on a shell casing harder as you use a gun the metal in deforms is a unique pattern almost like a metal finger print the firing pin imprints a now unique pattern on the shell casing and the bullet scrapes along the groves of the rifling leaving unique patterns  so taking the fired shell or recovered bullet and comparing the microscopic scrape marks you have a match

depends on context as well  i used to live in a really high traffic area there would be cars going by and people in the street all night it never bothered me so one in the apartment though instant awake  one time i went and visited a friend in a rural city almost no noise i kept getting worked up by people talking down the street 
there might be a genetic element but i think it has a lot to do with environment ever notice that light sleepers tend to be the oldest or an only child  i am a very heavy sleeper and i think it can be attributed to having 5 siblings and sharing bedrooms through my whole childhood  most of the people i talk to are jealous that i can sleep through pretty much anything and fall asleep pretty much anywhere you want your kids to have the same superpower  stop with this   shhhhh you're going to wake the   baby    nonsense and be normal your baby will sleep it's what they do 
syncope or feinting is essentially when you lose consciousness as a result of low blood pressure to the brain there are quite a few reasons as to what can trigger a feinting spell but the most common type is called vasovagal syncope  the symptoms are usually a sense of feeling lightheaded  feeling like you are about to throw up and a general loss of visual acuity  grey vision  tunnel vision  before ultimately blacking outloss of muscle control  medically there is nothing preventing someone from dreaming but its not a guaranteed thingat least no more than having or remembering a dream when you fall asleep naturally curiously though some patients have reported  hearing  or at least being aware of conversations while unconscious

there are a few theories where other universes could be  1 inside black holes  as black holes allow stuff to come in  but never let anything out  there could be entire universes contained with in them and we would never be able to see them  2 contained within other dimensions alright  imagine a three dimensional box in this three dimensional box  you can put an infinite amount of two dimensional squares  one layered on top of the other if we could imagine these squares as two dimensional universes  there is always room for more two dimensional universes in a three dimensional box  and none of the two dimensional universes interact the same is true for three dimensional cubes in fourth dimensional cubes  technically called tesseracts   or even higher dimensional constructs  3 contained within our own now  if the universe is infinite  and the physical laws don't change  there would be an infinite amount of alternate earths with an infinite amount of you and me while it's all technically the same universe  the vast distances we can't even imagine on a astronomical scale  it's effectively different universes  of course  this is all completely speculative  as we can't directly test any of these hypothesies 
because there is a difference  or so i've heard

as people have said  most of those numbers are defined that way because of the units we use there are  however  some numbers  such as pi  that don't depend on units and are just that the most well known is the fine structure constant  which is roughly 1137035  but that number isn't based on any units  because it's a ratio it's a topic of research to figure out why it's that number and not something more round  but the answer seems to kinda be  that s just the way the universe is

it goes all the way back to your earliest stages of embryonic development a simple hollow sphere of cells  the  blastula   https  enwikipediaorgwikiblastula  folds in on itself to form two layers of cells with an opening  which will eventually become your anus  in the process called  grastrulation   https  enwikipediaorgwikigastrulation  your lips and your anus are the ends of one long tube  the digestive tract  and all of the cells in that tube are derived from the  primary germ layer   http  embryoasuedupagesgermlayers  called the  endoderm   https  enwikipediaorgwikiendoderm  the rest of your skin is formed by cells of a different germ layer  the outer layer  called the  ectoderm   https  enwikipediaorgwikiectoderm  a third primary germ layer also forms  the  mesoderm   https  enwikipediaorgwikimesoderm  which gives rise to the musculoskeletal system but it isn't directly involved in the answer to this question  yes  the actual answer is that at one point in the earliest stages of the embryonic growth of every human we were all pretty near nothing but an asshole

the impetus for the pearl harbor attack was the us placing an oil embargo on japan  which pretty much  any  country 100  dependent on foreign sources for oil would consider an act of war  by attacking pearl harbor  they hoped to eliminate  or at least cripple the us pacific fleet naval combat was still a major  deciding force in those days they might not have actually thought they could invade the us and win  although the  did  manage to invade and hold one of the aleutian islands for a couple monthshardly the mainland   but they certainly hoped they could pull america s teeth in the pacific  but the raid was botched disastrously not only were all the allimportant aircraft carriers out to sea and thus spared  but even the bombing that did occur was not that effective only three ships were damaged beyond repair  perhaps even worse  the japanese attackers also failed to bomb the oil storage tanks near pearl harbor they knew about them  but had bought into the myth that america was awash in oil  and they felt it would be pointless in reality  those tanks represented pretty much all the oil for the pacific fleet  and if they'd destroyed them  the fleet would have been essentially cut off from operating very far into the pacific for up to a year 
war was quickly becoming apparent between the two nations  so japan sought to cripple the us navy while it had a chance 
no  they did not actually believe they could beat the us in the sense of taking over the united states and occupying it  that wasn't their goal they were on a conquest in asia that was quite successful  but the allied powers were getting unhappy about it despite having their hands full taking control of pearl harbor would have seriously undermined us influence in the pacific  and made the us attacks on japan much more difficult and they almost did it japan may have been much much bigger if they won 
japan had one major experience fighting a western power  the russojapanese war in 1904  japan and russia were arguing over influence in korea and manchuria russia refused a deal  and so japan launched a surprise naval attack against the russian eastern fleet a few hours before declaring war  sound familiar yet    the japanese sunk or crippled several of the russian battleships  and it led to the russians staying in port after a series of battles  japan then laid siege to the main russian base  and managed to take it before a relief fleet could arrive then russia and japan negotiated a peace treaty  this was basically the same japanese plan  surprise attacks  cripple the us pacific fleet  then take their main base  in the philippines  before the us could mount a relief effort it worked once  and worked again  up to a point however  russia caved because it was much weaker and the people were agitating for a revolution against the tsar the us had a much different reaction  and an industrial base that would not collapse under the strain of war  like imperial russia   but would produce massive amounts of arms and ships 
they were attempting to destroy the us pacific fleet  but a large portion of the fleet was away from pearl harbor at the time 
should also be noted that 2 of the pacific fleet carriers  one of which was later almost solely responsible for winning the battle of midway  were not in pearl harbor during the attack should they have been sunk the pacific theatre would have most likely turned out very differently  the battle of midway was the turning point in naval power and you can argue the us victory was gained on the whim  luck  of one of the air wing commanders 
japan had 8 aircraft carriers and the us had 4 destruction of the us battleships should have given japan a decisive advantage  but as we now know  battleships were obsolete 
it s good medical practice for any injection  preventing infection of the wound as well as contamination of the equipment you might ask whether it has a use during an execution  but executions are in many ways designed to be as humane as possiblein part because the law requires it  and in part because many advocates of the death penalty don't actually want the convict to suffer so there s no reason to deviate from the medical standard  a death sentence is not a license to mistreat the prisoner 
in theory  he could get a pardon or commuted sentence just before the injection process begins once the process begins  probably not very important if the injection site was sanitized or not 

for any such number where there are units of measurement involved  like the speed of light  it's because the units are not derived from that phenomenon humans defined miles  kilometers  seconds  minutes  etc  first then we used them to describe the speed of light it's like measuring a random tree in the forest what are the chances it ll be precisely 30 meters tall  as for pi  which is a pure mathematical ratio  there s no explanation it just is what it is 
the speed of light  atomic weight  and the gravitational constant are based on units that we invented  so if they were a round number  it would just be a coincidence  pi  on the other hand is a constant without a unit  being a ration between two things   explaining why pi is the number it is relies on some funky math that completely shows exactly why the ratio between the circumference of a circle and its diameter couldn't be anything other than 314159  but the the calculation doesn't give some grand  meaning  that is satisfying to the average person 
pi is a constant that is determined purely by geometry if you measure distances using the usual  shortest straight line  method in the plane  your circles will involve pi  numbers like the speed of light and gravitational constant depend on your choice of unit  they are not  dimensionless  constants   you can make them integers by choosing particular units  in the same way that you can make the 169 miles to a friend s house an integer by simply saying it's  1 friendistance   atomic weight is  for most elements  an average of the weights of several different isotopes an average  at random proportions  is very unlikely to be an integer in the first place 
there is an infinite amount of numbers whole numbers are a specific set of numbers  which is much smaller than the entire set of numbers  despite being infinite as such  it's more likely to be a decimal like 314 continuing than a whole number 
i'm actually kind of upset that c  speed of light is not exactly 300000000 ms  since 1983  the metre has been officially defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1299792458 of a second damn  it's almost recursive 
there are systems of measurement units where the universal constants are round numbers just has not caught on in normal use https  enwikipediaorgwikinatural_units  systems_of_natural_units
as people have said  most of those numbers are defined that way because of the units we use there are  however  some numbers  such as pi  that don't depend on units and are just that the most well known is the fine structure constant  which is roughly 1137035  but that number isn't based on any units  because it's a ratio it's a topic of research to figure out why it's that number and not something more round  but the answer seems to kinda be  that s just the way the universe is 
so we have a 3d universe  but if there are other universes where would they be  could there be a 4th dimension people can't visualize where you can have multiple infinite 3d universes  but then could there be infinite universes  like the parallel universe theories predict if this is all true  how could we get in the 4th dimension  i'm so confused  also  i have some knowledge about this stuff  but try to keep it in simple terms  
if there are only 3 dimensions  how can many radios each tune into a different station moving through the  same space   other  universes  are similar as vibrations which dont much interfere with eachother they are all here 
i don't really understand how these attribution  copyright use work if i run a website  could i use any material from other sites as long as i provide the attribution  do i still need to contact the owner first if i do that  thank you
those sites are probably technically breaking the copyrights of the content creators you can't just google up images and then put them on your website and remain on the right side of copyright law just because some people do it and get away with it doesn't mean you will  no  just providing attribution does not get you on the right side of copyright law  either you actually do have to secure permission  and possibly pay license fees  in order to be 100  legal it's possible that some content you will want to use would be released under a permissive license like creative commons  but that s up to the creator of the content and there s no blanket permission to use whatever you want  yes  people do this all the time no  they're probably not legal in a technical sense no  they probably will never get caught even if they are caught  the most likely thing that will happen is that they will just stop using that content and replace it with something else yes  you could probably also get away with it for a little blog that only your parents and your friends read when your blog gets listed on reddit or something  and thereby comes to the attention of the content creators whose work you are using  you will almost certainly be in a world of shit 
i ve almost blacked out from throwing up violently  but i do remember one time when i was young  maybe 5  i was sledding on one of those disc shaped sleds and ran into a soccer goal and i don't remember anything after that for a while 
i believe that they were hoping to damage the us navy enough so that when they inevitably retaliate japan will be strong enough to repel the us  both had sights on philippines and japan thought that us intervention will be less likely if they cripple the us navy first

basically  it was racism they figured that the americans were playboys and dilettantes without the stomach for a long fight as fdr  said   http  wwwpresidencyucsbeduws  pid  16224  10 weeks after the attack  gt  ever since this nation became the arsenal of democracyever since enactment of lendlease  there has been one persistent theme through all axis propaganda this theme has been that americans are admittedly rich  that americans have considerable industrial power  but that americans are soft and decadent  that they can not and will not unite and work and fight  gt  from berlin  rome  and tokyo we have been described as a nation of weaklings   playboys   who would hire british soldiers  or russian soldiers  or chinese soldiers to do our fighting for us  gt  let them repeat that now 
all of those numbers are  random  or the result calculating phenomenons that are random a fun little quirk of mathematics is that if you choose a number at random  there is a   0    chance that will be a whole number in fact  there is a 0  chance that it will be a rational number 

it doesn't make it easier to keep center in lanes if you're on the side  you can make sure the left side of your car is in the right place  and that means the right side is too if the wheel is in the center  you don't know where either side is as well 
it is not entirely known  in part because  sleep  is hard to define in fish some fish do have very sleeplike behavior  but others have none it is suggested that some fish can obtain the benefits of sleep simply from their habitual periods of low mental activity  such as when swimming through open waters over great distances 

it s strategy if you catch it and run  you are running the risk that you might fumble the ball to the other team  or that you will get tackled before the 20 yard line if you catch it and take a knee  or let it fall behind the endzone  you automatically start at the 20 yard line 
it depends on the situation on the field if they let it fall there is zero chance for a fumble and the returning team gets the ball if they wave for a fair catch they can not be tackled and have to take a knee but if they drop the catch it is a fumble catching and running gives the best chance to get farther down the field but is the most risky if the opposing team is close to the punt returner 
they ll run it if they think they can gain ground  if they don't think they ll gain any ground  they ll call a  fair catch  by signaling with thier arm  this is basically saying  don't tackle me i'm not going to run the ball anywhere we agree to start here  taking a knee is for when there s a turnover  and the ball is kicked into  and caught in the endzone  the person takes a knee it's kind of like a  fair catch   only they ll start on thier 20 yard line they ll do this if they think they won't be able to get past the 20 yard line if they run it

if the hackers were really about political change the message could be that these public officials and corporate oligarchs will be held publicly accountable for their actions  but i dont think true political change is what the hackers are after its about the lulz 
first  this is changing pretty quickly lots of good breweries are canning these days my own research indicates that the canning line is more expensive to buy but has lower operating costs than a bottling line  as to why  good  beer has historically come in bottles rather than cans  it's mainly consumer perception  bottles just had more perceived quality than cans did if you are trying to sell beer for  10six rather than  6  you have to make the consumer feel like it's worth it  cans probably got a bad rap because when you drink straight from the container  they can make the beer taste tinny also  early cans were not as good as current cans  with coatings on the inside that could flake off  leading to tinny flavor even if you drank from a glass  it's the same reason that people preferred green glass over amber for a while  because the european imports they saw were in green glass  they associated that with a higherquality beer  even though beer in green glass skunks more easily a similar calculation goes into choosing pryoff caps over twistoffs  twistoffs are associated with cheap beer  so all the  good  breweries use pryoffs to differentiate their product 
generally speaking  glass is non reactive  so there s no worry that part of the bottle will react with the beer inside and alter the flavor  this is why most chemistry glassware is  well  glass it can be depended on not to interact with the chemicals  aluminum will react with acidic substances  and could alter the flavor of what it contains if there is not a good quality coating inside the can to prevent a reaction from occurring  as mentioned by others  modern cans are usually more than adequate to not alter the beer they contain  so there s no reason not to use them for high quality beer just like soda  which is also typically pretty acidic 

also originally there were only two lane roads passing a vehicle in front of you would be extremely difficult if you couldn't see down the road to determine if another vehicle was coming in the opposite direction 
consider pi there are an infinite number of decimal numbers in between 2 and 3 it could be any one of them

the mid  part is the key  dawn and dusk used to mark the new day  in some cultures  but those markers vary with the seasons  while noon  and midnight remain constant in step with the actual days  noon was kind of an awkward point for a change of date  so midnight got the cigar 
it s easy to see how sunrise would be considered the start of the new day so somewhere in the middle of sunset and sunrise is the middle of the night  when the old day ends  and the new day begins  it's only in perhaps the last 150 years that the people could do things after sunset for most of human history  the night was only for monsters  evil sprits and criminals

 this thread   https  wwwredditcomrexplainlikeimfivecomments2nru9keli5_why_does_the_pouring_sound_of_liquids_change   may help 
because there is a difference  or so i've heard 
behavior  how you express yourself to other people  habits attitude  the thoughts and feelings that turn into behaviors character  moral and mental strength personality  the predispositions that make someone naturally gravitate to certain attitudes  and thus  behaviors  personality doesn't really change  some debate on this among psychologists   behaviors are the easiest to change  since it's simple habit breaking attitudes are more tough  but doable with mind hacks character starts low and builds throughout life  assuming someone is receptive to the lessons around them 
cans protect beer from light better than bottles because they are more opaque cans are made of metal  which are more chemically reactive than glass  so bottles protect beer from some chemical reactions better than cans which results in better tasting beer is up for debate i forget the brand  but there was one beer that advertised it had cans with glass  or glasslike  liners to get the best of both worlds 
the difference in most jurisdictions is explicit money for services or unfairly choosing one business over another for example  if i'm the head of a construction company  i might make contributions to a politician who has probusiness views  who then lowers taxes  which would be okay however  if i told him that i would give him money explicitly so he'd lower taxes or so he'd give my business a government contract  that would be an obvious bribe also  you normally have to file certain paperwork for campaign contributions while bribes are normally more secretive  trying to prove this sort of corruption can be pretty difficult and the specific laws can be complex 
especially since the supreme court s decision that campaign contributions  even from corporations  were an expression of the right to free speech very little  individual campaign contributions are capped  under the law and over a certain amount  must be made public  so the size of your institutionally recognized bribe is both public  and limited  political contributions from organizations and registered lobbyists must also be made public  so the only penalty for our institutionalized form of bribery is political embarrassment   if anybody happens to be paying attention   which  sadly  we usually don't  about the only way you can be charged with bribery these days  is to make an agreement to sell influence or a vote in exchange for a a specified favor or amount of cash  and have it found out  why would anybody bother  where is madame de farge  now  when we really need her     
i writing this under the assumption you mean blackhats  sometimes it's the appeal of vigilante justice such as when a group of hackers released a list of public officials who are a part of the kkk everyone wants to be like batman in their own way  other times it is just a ploy to embarrass their enemies and gain street cred er  web cred 
they don't necessarily there is a general trend towards canning these days in the brewing industry a big factor is cost  an even bigger factor is minimizing things that can make the beer go bad bottling these days is almost exclusively done through counter pressure filling  the bottle is pressurized while filling   this was expensive and hard to do with cans nowadays there are systems that can do it  but most breweries would have open can filling and a seamer which crimps the lid on there is a high risk of oxygen pickup producing cans this way also  there seems to be a general consensus that bottles are  classier   so a nicer beer would inevitably be bottled the light issue is really only evident in clear  or green bottles

for the general  it depends on where you live if you live in a solidly republican or solidly democrat state  then it really doesn't but those that live in  battleground  states where neither party has dominance  their votes matter quite a bit  but primaries for the parties  yes  your vote does matter 
yes but you are limited in your options  some statesparties spent huge amounts of money to keep competitors off the ballots and restrict your choice to someone who has been chosen for you to choose from

the candidates seem to think it matters the party nominees are going to end up spending about a billion dollars each trying to get votes they won't spend a lot in my home state because we've voted for the same party for over 30 years  but i still get to have my say in primaries  i also believe that every vote is important in the  long  run my vote won't determine who wins my state this november but every extra vote for the losing candidate is a tiny little message to the winning party that there are still people here who disagree with them every extra tiny vote for the loser makes it a teeny bit more likely that the winners will have to consider paying attention to people like me next time if they want to keep winning

part of it may come from a phenomenon called high place phenomenon http  wwwnbcnewscomhealthbodyoddweirdurgejumpbridgeexplainedf424037 essentially it's this strange pull to desire things we don't actually desire because our body is confused why we are doing something that seems uncomfortable watching crush videos seems gross and wrong to most of us but some people may be triggered to feel like they like the images because of the high place phenomena some scientists think this is where humans get strange and gross desires during sex in general i won't give examples but i'm sure your imagination can think of other gross things people masturbate to  like hentai   it may be just a matter of your brain being confused why you're watching something so it may interpret the stimuli as sexually arousing

it is my understanding that stress causes your body to release chemicals  such as adrenaline and cortisol  that are normally useful in the short term  eg  preparing your body to run away from danger  but can cause damage in the long term  such as creating effects similar to aging  when it comes specifically to wrinkles  those are often created by repeated folding of the skin like how the lines on your hand are caused by the way your skin folds when you move your fingers or shoe leather develops cracks and wrinkles around the area that your show bends when you walk people tend to make faces when they are stressed because of our instinctive use of our faces to communicate our feelings to others  so stress can cause people to make faces that cause the skin to crease such as the creation of worry lines  conversely  there are also what are known as laugh lines  which are caused by the way the skin of your face creases when you smile 
can it make you go grey 


they rely on reports from air traffic control since planes unavoidably fly in more or less the same path  the primary goal is to keep planes that are nearby at different altitudes to prevent any risk of a collision if the traffic controllers are confused or their equipment doesn't work  or the pilots do not promptly respond to instructions  accidents occur

my 4 year old cousin asked me out of the blue what bills are  and before i answered her question i told her i'd come back to her what i'm really doing is asking you guys how to simplify it in a way that she could understand 
sometimes you buy things by handing the other person some money  right  if someone trusts you  they might let you buy something if you just promise to pay them later  a bill is a piece of paper where they write down how much money you promised to pay for that thing  whatever it was they send it to you so that you remember how much money you are supposed to pay 
bills are when adults pay for things they used in the past month electricity has a bill because the electric company is asking you to pay for all the electricity you used all at once instead of everytime you turn on the lights  as far as other responsibilities people get jobs to pay for all the things they want to buy they clean and do other tasks to make the things they buy look and work nicely they pay taxes so the government will give them things like roads and schools they go to the store to buy food and other things they want  basically all adult things are methods of making money to buy things and spending money on things they want 
so we have a 3d universe  but if there are other universes where would they be  could there be a 4th dimension people can't visualize where you can have multiple infinite 3d universes  but then could there be infinite universes  like the parallel universe theories predict if this is all true  how could we get in the 4th dimension  i'm so confused  also  i have some knowledge about this stuff  but try to keep it in simple terms  
if there are only 3 dimensions  how can many radios each tune into a different station moving through the  same space   other  universes  are similar as vibrations which dont much interfere with eachother they are all here 
okay lets start with dimensions  yes we live in a universe with three physical dimensions the fourth dimension refers to time  or more specifically  causality  the process in which a transformation or change causes changes another change or transformation within the universe  basically the concept of cause and effect as causality determines the direction in which time flows  the important thing to realize here is that this model is what is defined by the standard model of physics  or our current accepted  interpretation  of physical laws of the universe various other theories such as the multiverse theories  string theory  supersymmetry theory  or super string theory offer varying interpretations of the physical laws which govern our universe now i use the word interpretation not as in that these laws or somehow not concrete or defined  they are definitely defined and established  it is simply how we connect these laws  in regards to the multiple universes  although our current model of physics doesn't account for the existence of multiple universes in a multiverse  the other mentioned theories and models do i would recommend a book called hyperspace by michio kaku which explains multiverses  branes  higher dimensions  as well as many other topics in great depth  though with layman s terms so it is easy for average person to understand 
there are a few theories where other universes could be  1 inside black holes  as black holes allow stuff to come in  but never let anything out  there could be entire universes contained with in them and we would never be able to see them  2 contained within other dimensions alright  imagine a three dimensional box in this three dimensional box  you can put an infinite amount of two dimensional squares  one layered on top of the other if we could imagine these squares as two dimensional universes  there is always room for more two dimensional universes in a three dimensional box  and none of the two dimensional universes interact the same is true for three dimensional cubes in fourth dimensional cubes  technically called tesseracts   or even higher dimensional constructs  3 contained within our own now  if the universe is infinite  and the physical laws don't change  there would be an infinite amount of alternate earths with an infinite amount of you and me while it's all technically the same universe  the vast distances we can't even imagine on a astronomical scale  it's effectively different universes  of course  this is all completely speculative  as we can't directly test any of these hypothesies 
this is perhaps a bit beyond the scope of the sub  but let's see one of the theories i like best says that these other universes  dimensions  whatever you call them  occupy the same points in space that ours does they just exist at a different point in time kind of like how you and i exist at the same point in time  but not the same spacial location so an alternate you would be sitting right where you are  but at a point in time you've already left or haven't yet arrived at
i ve never fainted before is there any changes in blood pressure or brain activity or anything like that  and do people dream when they faint like if they were just sleeping 
there are a lot of reasons people faint  if you get hit hard enough  your brain may knock against the inside your skull and may shut down as a defense mechanism  you may have low blood pressure  which will caused oxygen supply to lower to the brain your brain responds by shutting down  you may be hyperventiliating  which also interferes with oxygen to the brain  what your brain does  is basically knocks you out so that you will become horizontal this will make it easier for your heart to pump oxygen to the brain fainting is  in this respect  a survival reflex  as for what it's like  it sucks i get vasovagal syncope from time to time  though now i know what triggers it  anxiety attacks  and how to combat them directly so it doesn't happen anymore  i have no perception of the passing out  when i wake up  it's like everything is fuzzy and slow and really far away i am totally disoriented   to share an embarassing story  the first time it happened to me  i was on the toilet i was going through some weight loss  and had overdone it at the gym for a week and didn't eat enough i was at like 1800 calories and really should have been eating more like 2800 or more  so  on the toilet got dizzy got a stomache ache woke up totally freaking out and thinking i was gon na die  horrible  but  i saw a doctor  it happened again  and we talked about what was going on and how to prevent it 
i ve fainted a fair amount of times it suuuuuuucks your body just shuts off only takes a few seconds but it feels like an eternity hearing goes  vision goes  then bam i've never dreamt  but i've never been out for more than a few seconds it really is horrible 
syncope or feinting is essentially when you lose consciousness as a result of low blood pressure to the brain there are quite a few reasons as to what can trigger a feinting spell but the most common type is called vasovagal syncope  the symptoms are usually a sense of feeling lightheaded  feeling like you are about to throw up and a general loss of visual acuity  grey vision  tunnel vision  before ultimately blacking outloss of muscle control  medically there is nothing preventing someone from dreaming but its not a guaranteed thingat least no more than having or remembering a dream when you fall asleep naturally curiously though some patients have reported  hearing  or at least being aware of conversations while unconscious 
for me  i can say that i do  dream  every time and it's usually just as if life had kept on without the faint like i'm continuing what i was doing the absolute worst part of it  though  is the waking up that to me is far scarier than fainting itself my brain coming out of dream mode where everything had been fine to hearing people  if i'm not alone  saying my name over and over in an attempt to pull me out of it only i can't respond yet i can't open my eyes no matter how hard i try i just have to wait it out in the black  even though i've become fully aware of my surroundings 
had the vasovagal syncope reaction happen several times when violently ill the very first time i fought the reaction  which probably made it worse  thought i was dying at home alone  called my mom out of work with the most desperately breathless  i'm dying i need halp  before blacking out and waking up not a minute later completely disoriented i read somewhere that there s a reaction from your blood pressure dropping too rapidly  judging from other comments  i suppose the blood pressure drop results in a similar drop of oxygen to the brain  so it takes a little break 
i ve almost blacked out from throwing up violently  but i do remember one time when i was young  maybe 5  i was sledding on one of those disc shaped sleds and ran into a soccer goal and i don't remember anything after that for a while 
i had 34 fainting spells over the last few years i can concur that it does suck  in general i feel really nauseous about 3 minutes before and sometimes get tinnitus in one ear also i get overheated and sweaty  one time i was on a train and made it off the train only to faint on the concrete platform i actually don't  remember anything between getting off the train and waking up on the ground  had to get 5 stitches in my chin and bruised a rib  another time i was at a sit down show  my wife and friends held me up so i wouldn  t collapse on the row in front  but being held upright caused my brain to lose oxygen and my body reacted by vomiting everywhere  so yeah  it really sucks the fainting itself is dangerous in that you just go down and can really hurt yourself  and the leadup is highly unpleasant 
i have been unconscious several different ways and never have i dreamed or anything like that  the time always passed instantaneously  i was knocked the fuck out tobogganing as a kid and it was one moment sledding into a tree and the next lying on the ground sore all over  i passed out giving blood in highschool because i hadn't eaten much or drank any water they tilted me back to get blood back to the brain and your body tries to get as much there as possible so your head gets very hot  it can actually be dangerous so they have fans and shit  overall not very nice and made me very nauseous pretty much the same experience being choked unconscious while training jiu jitsu and my partner squeezed a choke a bit too tight  but that one wasn't as bad and i was only out for like a second  also had a very bad concussion skiing and i didn't go out but i lost memory from about five minutes before and an hour afterwards  apparently a nurse asked me a bunch of questions and i got all of them wrong  like didn't know my name or age  overall most pleasant experience was being sedated for a surgery which was basically like a very deep dreamless sleep and i woke up very well rested  from my understanding all of these area a result of something making your brain shut down  sometimes just partially  because of several different reasons either an impact that forces your mind to basically reset  getting too little oxygen for brain function or a drug putting you out  tl  dr i've been out basically every way possible and each one is pretty much my brain not being able to handle something so it dips 
i ve lost conciseness a few times i can tell when it's going to happen and can usually prevent it or mitigate it  typically is just when i'm getting blood drawn   usually light headed  with a double helping of dizzy the worst if when i'm so far gone i can't communicate anymore happened once when i was at the doctor s office getting an ingrown toenail removed  tried to say i didn't feel well  but i couldn't physically get anything to come out was told when i passed out i went into convulsions  each time when i started to come to  i was dreaming very disorientating to wake up because for a few seconds i have no idea where i am or why the fuck i'm on the floor then my memory comes back and is just embarrassing 
when i toast some hot cross buns in the toaster  pretty soon the whole house is filled with the scent of fresh hot cross buns however  room temperature or cold food doesn't have its scent travel at all  you need to be right next to it to smell it  how is this  scent amplification  caused

well  lets think about some more common english names last names came about to distinguish who you were talking about  to make it clear you were talking about john the farmer  not john the smith or john the fletcher or john the tailor or john the carter so  someone with the last name  farmer  probably had a paternal ancestor who was a farmer way back in time but there were a lot of farmers  and smiths and fletchers and tailors and carters  back in the day  and not all of them were related  and neither are their descendants

when you are choking  it is very dangerous as it can kill you the human body does many actions to stop you from choking one of these actions is coughing  pushing air up your throat this also pushes air up your tear ducts where you tears normally  drain  out of this pushes your tears back up to your eyes  and out making them water 

clusters are held together by gravity even though there is an outward expansionary  pull   the inward pressure of gravity is stronger and it keeps the cluster in place 

sound is vibrations in the air  when you pour water into a container  you create waves in the water these waves push and pull against the air above them  causing the air to vibrate this vibration in the air bounces around the walls of the container  causing it to resonate  trapping a vibration inside a container like this  causing it to resonate  is the basic principle behind most musical instruments   as the container fills up  there s less air inside it to vibrate the sound waves bouncing back and forth between the walls have less distance to cover on each trip from wall to wall so they take less time between each bounce the frequency of the vibration goes up  which means that when your ears sense the vibration  they perceive a higher pitch 
a fun little fact as well apparently cockroaches like tight spaces because they feel safe and comforted got told that by an exterminator and honestly it's the only thing that i like about them 
the annual percentage rate is the interest rate that you would get charged each year  even if you're actually charged each month or in some other period in the us  many lenders are required to display their rates as aprs to allow consumers to have easy comparisons between rates  if you are charged compounding interest every month  as with most credit cards  an apr of 23  means a monthly interest of 17401   it works out to be 23   and not just 12 times the monthly interest  because you will be charged interest on the previous interest  compounding   the standard  truth in lending  disclosure or your full card agreement should describe the precise means by which your interest is calculated 

essentially the answer is simply  we don't know the idea of a parallel universe is entirely speculation and may or may not be true even if it is true we really don't have a way of finding out the answer to those questions however if we assume they exist on the same basic principles we do  they would have matter  space  time  and probably rules to the balance of all those  which we call physics   how all of those exist however is impossible to know 
for all intensive purposes the laws governing parrallel universes include such  1 parallel universes do not cover paradoxes  ie a parallel universe without a parallel universe  2 parallel universes have principes of spacetime and physics 3 parallel universes have some form of elements or elementalbased bonding  can form matter and have valence electrons or movements in the universe even if it is just one type of matter or only one element  4 parallel universes must have atoms or particles  however it can vary how they move as either waves  particles  both  or neither

it s called the  great recession  because although there was a strong recession  meaning a decrease in size of the economy  there was no depression  which is a longer period of stagnation following a recession what characterized the great depression was that it took a long time for conditions to improve  whereas we recovered from the great recession quite quickly in america  in an aggregate economic sensenot necessarily every industry or place

the biggest problem is that transistors  performance degrades with increased temperature the two key things that define a give transistor are its  threshold voltage   the voltage where it turns on  and its drive current  how much current it can provide when it is turned on hard   the big issue is that higher temperatures strongly degrade the  drive current   this reduces the transistor s ability to quickly turn on other transistors that it is connected to  so if an integrated circuit gets too hot  it will slow down below its rated speed at that point  circuits can fail to work as intended and all sorts of screwy behavior is possible the most likely problem  however  is memory corruption  in the cpu s internal caches   if you keep the temperature of the device below its rated value  then you shouldn't have to worry they are typically tested at hot temperatures to ensure that even when they get hot they will still meet timing that s why overclocking is possible if you keep the microprocessor cool  you can run it faster than its worstcase speed  even if you don't run a microprocessor hot enough to misbehave  running any integrated circuit hot for long periods of time will tend to make it more likely to experience a reliability failure almost all of the failure mechanisms that affect such devices are accelerated by temperature the general rule of thumb is that for every 10 degrees c you elevate the temperature  you reduce the lifetime by a factor of 3  that wasn't formerly too big of a deal  since most microprocessors had such good reliability that even if you reduced the lifetime by a large value  it would still last as long as you were likely to use it that really isn't so true these days it's gotten very hard to make parts that are high performance  cheap  and extremely reliable so the reliability margin has been reduced quite a bit   source  i'm a former reliability engineer who worked with intel

in a highly simplified view yes but life is rarely that simplified  take for example music on cd cds now are incredibly cheap compared to about 20 years ago despite that  total demand for cds is not increasing world has moved on to digital download or streaming  another example is gasoline for this  we ll ignore that fluctuations in supply also impact pricing in 2000  large suvs and trucks were common  cars were fairly inefficient in fuel consumption around 2008ish  gas prices spiked  that changed consumer demand structurally  even if a hybrid existed in 2001  it wasn't going to be a popular vehicle for most people today many former suv and truck owners have switched to more fuel efficient vehicles many electric cars and various hybrids exist today gas prices are fairly cheap  but total gas volumes have declined because there isn't the same level of demand 
that s the general idea  but price isn't the only demand driver often times  demand drops because there s a better product to fulfill that demand at this point the brandnew iphone has a high price point  but that price drops once a newer model comes out  because the new product fulfills that demand better in many cases  no amount of dropping the price on the old model is going to entice buyers back who care more about having the latest and greatest more than they do about the cost 
it could yes  but then it may do the opposite  once the price goes up the demand goes back down because people don't want it at a higher price if something like the ps4 has an inflated price because sony chooses to charge more for it than its equilibrium price then when it eventually goes down to that level  essentially where sony is happy selling that amount for that much money and people are okay with paying that much money and buying a certain number  then sony will leave it there because then both parties  supplier and consumer  are happy

yes  it is depending on how far out you consider the earth s atmosphere to go there is no hard line  since it tapers off  exosphere  700 to 10000 km  440 to 6200 miles  thermosphere  80 to 700 km  50 to 440 miles  mesosphere  50 to 80 km  31 to 50 miles  stratosphere  12 to 50 km  7 to 31 miles  troposphere  0 to 12 km  0 to 7 miles  the iss comes within 205 miles the atmosphere is very very thin in the thermosphere  but not nonexistent it's even thinner in the exosphere  and it is said that is the sphere where the atmosphere gets so thin it might as well be hard space 
gt  1 atmosphere is 147psi  that means there is 10 psi outside space station  assuming the suit is pressurized to one atmosphere  that s a bad assumption what you quoted in no way says that the suit is at 1 bar interior pressure while on a spacewalk  it only says that it's pressurized to ambient4psi  the pressure at the peak of everest is only about 5psi  https  enwikipediaorgwikimount_everest  environment

for example  the eu s right to be forgotten ruling requires search engines to remove links to certain information about eu citizens upon request if  hypothetically  google were to ignore this ruling and not remove any links  what could the eu actually do  google is us company operating on us servers if google were to ignore this ruling  what would happen  the way i see it  the most the eu could do is block google from being accessed within the eu but doing that would lead to massive disruptions in just about every area of business  and massive protests by eu citizens even if they sued google  would google be legally obligated by us law to appear  if the eu fined them  would us law require them to pay a fine from a foreign government  basically  what right does a foreign government have to tell a us company what to do 
by custom  if not international law  a company operating in a country other than its own  is expected to make at least a good faith effort to respect the laws in force  also  i think you underestimate the effect of local public opinion if local laws and mores are violated  there was a good reason that right to be forgotten law was passed in the eu  and we really should  probably would  have it here except that the business lobbies would never permit it to be passed
proteins are made up of stuff called amino acids the human body requires 20 different amino acids to be healthy  our bodies acutally produce 11 of these  which leaves 9 more that we must get from our diet  a  complete protein  contains all of these amino acids that we need to consume a few plants contain all of them  soy  quinoa   but most plants don't  so we need to eat a variety in order to get all the amino acids we need  basically  all plants  incomplete proteins  actually do help build muscle it's just that most of them are just a piece of the puzzle that our bodies must then put together  instead of having all the pieces together at once already

i could be wrong about this  finance major having taken only 4 total economics courses over my degree  so feel free to correct me  the value of a country s currency  say relative to the usd  is determined by how much people want to have that currency as you can imagine  people will only want that currency if they need to buy things that are denominated in that currency  because canada has a weak dollar  relative to the usa  and it wishes to purchase a lot of things that are denominated in usd  a good idea would be to strengthen its currency  but how do you do that  well  you increase the demand for canadian dollars  or alternatively  reduce the supply of canadian dollars  by selling its gold reserves  presumably in exchange for canadian dollars that it will remove from circulation in the market  it will result in a strengthening of the canadian dollar  so that we can buy all that cool stuff that the americans produce  sidenote  this is also why you always hear talk about china  cheating  the currency system china produces a ton of things that people want to buy  which are denominated in china s currency  so you would think there would be a very high demand for their currency  and thus a strong currency but that isn't the case the reason why is china prints a lot of money first of all  but also  when you purchase their stuff  the government will use a lot of that money to buy  opposite of canada  precious minerals to keep the value of their currency low  since there is a huge supply of their currency in the market  they do this so that they can keep the value of their currency low so that the value of their goods remain cheap for purchasers  which result in a huge trade surplus for the country this works for them since they generally don't buy a lot from other countries  but when they do buy stuff it's extremely expensive

in addition to untitleddocument37 s info on addressing  i would like to add some more information about how this complex process works  the main thing to realize is that your phone can only  yell  so loud to the tower there may only be a couple of towers that can even  hear  your phone nearby  you must also realize that your phone doesn't so much  yell  at the towers the way we would  it more chirps it sends an incredibly fast burst of data to the tower the tower can be set up to only listen at specific time slots  and the phones know this  so all the phones are chirping at different times to make sure they aren't chirping all at once frogs do this in a swamp when they are croaking to find a mate if everyone talked at once  nobody could hear anything at all  not only are all of our phones chirping at the towers at different time slots  they can also be using a different  pitch  or frequency  the tower s  ear  can selectively listen to a small frequency range  or  pitch   kinda how you can tune someone out when they are asking you to take out the garbage and you are listening to a video or song instead  imagine how much different a piano song would sound if you could only hear two or three individual notes if everyone could only hear their own few note range  a piano tune would sound completely different to all of them  these are gross simplifications of what the towers do to get your data to you and not have it collide with someone else s data  tldr  phone s don't broadcast that loud and try to talk on different frequencies at different times to avoid collisions

depends on how new the clothes are  whether or not  and how much  fabric softener they use  if they have hair around their belly buttons  ect there s a lot of factors that go into it and basically it's just kind of a lifestyle answer if you dont use a clean lint trap in your dryer  use a lot of fabric softener  dont shave your belly  and wear a lot of new clothes  you ll probably get belly button lint or maybe it's just a hidden superpower who knows 

modern 3d glasses work by polarizing the light so that every frame switches between eyes  and they can give you the  left eye  video and  right eye  video in your left and right eyes  old 3d glasses differentiated between eyes by just having red and blue light on the screen at the same time the red lens would filter out the red light and the blue lense would filter out the blue light so that your eyes would be seeing two different sets of images  this trick was easier to do because you could get away with a normal number of frames per second  whereas the modern glasses require twice the frames per second to get the same effect  among other reasons that i'm not an expert in understanding

the democratic party nearly nominated clinton in 2008 and the last 8 years have been spent with everyone talking about it was a given that she'd get the nomination this time around  last time  she was pretty much expected to get it but obama surprised a lot of people   she's well known  has a solid track record amp  more experience with the presidency than pretty much any living person that s eligible for the office  nobody really wants to waste their time  money amp  political capital on a run against her they're all willing to wait for the next cycle or the the one after that to run  bernie sanders is sort of a surprise at his age  this is pretty much his last chance to run amp  he's surprising a lot of people by making as solid of a showing as he has

republicans have a long history of nominating the next in line that is  the most senior person or most prominent on the national stage usually it is a vp or senior senator or a famous governor as they say   republicans fall in line  democrats fall in love   however  this time there was no obvious next in line romney lost  his vp pick was a congressman  not even in the leadership at the time   the previous vp pick is a national punchline the field was very weak  so many people jumped in to try to get traction it isn't working out so well  from a national election standpoint  democrats fall in love generally it is a younger  revolutionary  candidate  or a big personality usually not the most senior person or next in line last time hillary was the huge favorite  but she had more of a fallinline vibe and obama definitely had the fallinlove vibe so he won but hillary is an incredibly smart person in the 7 years since  she has formed alliances  secured endorsements or letters of support from key people that might have been better candidates or opposed her  eg  elizabeth warren  kirsten gillibrand   she learned her lesson  and ended up with a very small field specifically devoid of any fallinlove candidate who is also electable of course  that isn't working out quite as well as she hoped either  though the odds are still in her favor  adding to that  there was the sense that she was nearly unbeatable the last time around  and now she is the same person except with extra experience as secretary of state haters aside  the fact is that her resume is better than any previous presidential candidate in history so  if you were a democrat you'd probably just wait 4 or 8 years and try when there isn't such a powerhouse in the race 
ping is just used to measure the roundtrip time between your computer and a target  for instance  how long it takes from sending a message to googlecom until receiving the response  packet loss is when a packet  for instance an echo request  as sent by ping  gets lost somewhere along the way  so  how does it affect your connection  higher latency just leads to sluggish and generally slow connection websites take long  er  to load  but eventually  everything should get done like writing an actual letter instead of an email  if you experience packet loss  some of the data actually gets lost if it's a connectionless protocol like udp  this might lead to corrupted or missing data  someone s voice breaking up on a skype call  etc   imagine handing your letter to some friend of a friend of the recipient it might get there or not  when using a reliable protocol like tcp  all the data will eventually get there  but might have to be resent multiple times until it actually goes through  which will again result in slower performance to stick with the analogy  this would be a registered letter  with a confirmation message upon successful delivery 
let s simplify this a bit for the sake of the explanation  assume that the airline has one ticket available for the flight you  and another 10 people are interested in this ticket the airline will sell its only ticket to the person that is first in line  you everyone else can not buy the ticket now  and they leave  a few days later  you decide that you do not want to travel on this ticket  you either want to return it  or exchange it for a different flight in this case  the airline has to refund you your money  or give you another ticket  but most importantly  they are now stuck with a ticket that people used to want in the past they have to wait until one of the previous 10 people realizes that the ticket is for sale before they can sell it again in this case  your action inconveniences the airline  not just as a cost of updating the list  which is relatively easy   but because they thought they had made a sale when in reality they didn't  now scale that up from one person to a full planeful of people the airline wants to make sure that when they fill up a plane  they have it filled up  and there will be no last minute surprises to dissuade you from returning the ticket  they will make it completely nonrefundable  so they won't care if the seat flies empty  it's already been paid for  or they will charge you a fee to changecancel the ticket  so they make some money back for the inconvenience you caused them 
the iss orbits at about 250km above the surface of the earth  the earth s atmosphere doesn't suddenly  stop  but rather gradually thins and has no hard cut off however  there is the karman line  which is common  but arbitrary  threshold used to separate the atmosphere from outerspace and is at 100 km  well below the issgt 
with all the push to switch to chip transactions  i have two followup questions   1  why do about half the businesses i visit have the chip readers but tell you not to use them because they don't work  and  2  why hasn't my bank sent me a debit card with a chip on it 
there isn't a fine line between where earth s atmosphere ends and space begins the iss is not fully outside of the atmosphere  it is in a  low earth orbit   https  enwikipediaorgwikilow_earth_orbit  meaning it still experiences atmospheric drag without constant refueling and upkeep it's orbit will decay and it will burn up in the atmosphere 
uteekno s answer accounts for your example and most of the cases in other cases  however  it's a matter of convenience i used to work for an adult website  and even though it was entirely eubased it complied with the us dmca law why  because it has become the standard for this kind of websites  and since half the users are from the us anyway it was easier to go along with it

i'm currently in ecuador  which has a similar situation poor economy but insanely high taxes on anything imported  which is a lot   from what i've seen  it all comes down to where you get it for example  smartphones it seems like everyone has one even though they're quite spendy but enough searching and you can find some independent store that sells smart phones for a relatively low cost  there are  of course  always those who are decently wealthy as well and can easily afford these luxury items  within their own economy  without having to go bargain hunting

yes they did  the japanese believed the entire aircraft carrier fleet america possessed to be stationed in pearl harbor during the hours the japanese attacked but in reality  the aircraft carriers where in fact not  the japanese plan was to knock usa out of the geographical location and take over vital resources immediately surrounding japanese mainland  but apparently they did not succeed  the japanese navy admiral isoroku yamamoto said  i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve  after finding out the attack had failed to secure the required objective  https  enwikipediaorgwikiisoroku_yamamotos_sleeping_giant_quote

the japanese army commanders were traditionalist  hidebound  and not very wellversed in foreignwestern cultures they were of the belief that wiping out the us navy would eventually force the us into a truce  where japan got to keep their gains in asia  the japanese navy commanders were more educated  with many of their senior people having been educated in britain and the us  and they told the army commanders that this plan would not work and that the us would not sign a truce after being sneakattacked  unfortunately for everyone involved  the japanese army gained the upper hand in the empire s internal politics  and the japanese navy was basically ordered to come up with a plan to do what they'd already said would fail  the attack on pearl harbor was their best shot at putting the army s strategy into action and trying to quickly smash the us navy 
hemo derived from the latin for blood  philia derived from the latin for love of im pretty sure hemophiliacs aren't lovin  their bleesing disorder  so why is it still referred to as such 

it s good medical practice for any injection  preventing infection of the wound as well as contamination of the equipment you might ask whether it has a use during an execution  but executions are in many ways designed to be as humane as possiblein part because the law requires it  and in part because many advocates of the death penalty don't actually want the convict to suffer so there s no reason to deviate from the medical standard  a death sentence is not a license to mistreat the prisoner 
in theory  he could get a pardon or commuted sentence just before the injection process begins once the process begins  probably not very important if the injection site was sanitized or not 
the japanese wanted to destroy important ships within the us pacific fleet so that the fleet couldn't intervene with its invasion of what s now modern day indonesia and malaysia and weaken american morale so that they would commit to a war in the far pacific  in hindsight  the morale thing backfired horribly for a campaign mostly focused on battleships the okahlaoma and arizona were the only total losses 
i fainting for the first time this past decemberin the middle of a fucking shop stranger experience ever  fell to the floor and i immediately pushed myself back  i then lost my vision for about 2030 seconds about a minute later  i was right as rain  i know this doesn't answer your question but i just wanted to share my story
exactly as the title says i'm english not a rugby fan at all never played it either i watched the film concussion and couldn't see why hardly any rugby players are getting the same symptoms as say the guys who committed suicide even wwe wrestlers are really bad for it so what gives reddit people 
i think the first thing you have to do is establish that that is a fact it's very possible that at some point someone will actually go looking through rugby players and find  hey  this is actually really bad here too   since the whole concussion thing went unnoticed so long in football and wrestling since it appears mostly so many years later 
the position the players take in football  the players run in  literally head first   http  maxxelliblogcomwpcontentuploads201511americanfootballjpg   they are smashing and slamming their heads against each other rugby contact tends to be anywhere on the body but the head 
because they _know_ they are not wearing helmets  they are aware if they bang their heads on something  it will hurt  and hurt today  if one rugby player disregards headsafety  he will be injured and removed from the game  if an american football player rams people with his head  he might win the game and make lots of money  and 10 years later  he may have persistent problems

the cd has little beads of a chemical that react to the laser if the laser zaps a bead  it changes the reflective property so the drive can write 0s and 1s by zapping or not zapping each bead  one bead is one bit   then when it goes to read them  it can tell by the reflection whether it's 0 or 1  cdrw has chemicals that can be zapped a second time to reset them 

i just got hit with the infamous   imgur is over capacity   http  iimgurcom33mc5v7png   page  and it occurred to me  how can a website get the the page out if it's overloaded  from my  albeit limited  experience with servers  the  1 bottleneck is the internet connection  so if that s full  how can websites display this resourceheavy page  do they leave a certain portion of their bandwidth open for error messages  and if so  would it not be easier to just send the user their image 
i ve searched this subreddit and found two posts regarding this  but the only explanation was that changing the name on a ticket would mean the manifest or load sheet would need to be updated i can understand that being an issue after you check in  but if you book a few months in advance it doesn't seem like it would be a huge deal to update some paperwork what s the big deal with updating the manifest 
there are two situations you could be referring to and the odds are if you're confused it's because you're conflating the two there are  punts  and  kickoffs    a  punt  is when the team with the ball is on it's fourth down  and rather than risk turning the ball over to the other team after their next play  they opt to punt it back to the other team instead the ball will end up back an additional 3040 yards  but it ll end up in the other team s possession the offensive team snaps the ball back to a guy standing behind the line  the punter    he catches the ball  drops is from chestheight  and then kicks it downfield   http  i880photobucketcomalbumsac6cmpainpuntgif   a  kickoff  is when the offensive team has just scored  either by touchdown or field goal  and now the ball goes to the other team they put the ball on a tee at the 35yard line  and a guy standing about 15 yards behind the ball  the kicker    takes a running start and kicks it as far as he can down the field   https  mediagiphycommedia5xtdarzcaams4luhyeigiphygif  why am i making this distinction  because  the rules of football differ depending on which play is being run   specifically they differ on what happens if nobody from the other team touches the ball during a punt or a kickoff if nobody touches the ball during a  punt   the ball eventually comes to a stop at that point the play is whistled  dead  and the ball s awarded to the receiving team at the spot the ball stopped moving  if nobody touches the ball during a  kickoff   the ball remains live in fact  if a member of the   kicking team   grabs the ball   subject to certain rules  that go beyond an eli5  then they get the ball  so a member of the receiving team really needs to grab the ball  so with that in mind  here are the decisions to be made    during a punt     punt into the end zone   if the punt goes very deep  like past the receiving team s ten yard line  then it's in real danger of going into the end zone if it does  then the receiving team is awarded the ball on the 20 yard line so the punt returner  the guy who s job it is to catch the punt  will often just let the ball drop amp  bounce  hoping it goes into the end zone and they can get the ball on the 20 without a fuss this is a good deal for the receiving team  if the ball would have been caught at the 5  and you offered them a guaranteed 15yard return with a guarantee of nothing bad  fumbles  injuries  etc  happening  they'd sign up    punt fair caught   if the punt goes very   high    and it's in no danger of going into the end zone  then often it gets fair caught it's very high  so it hangs up there a while  giving the punting team plenty of time for their guys to get downfield right next to the returner and they're getting all set to line up and take the guy s head off to avoid this the punt returner waves his arms like he's flagging a passing car  and then catches the punt where it's going to first hit the ground the opposing team isn't allowed to touch him but he's not allowed to run with the ball since he probably would ve gotten obliterated the moment he caught the ball  and maybe something bad happens  fumble  injury  etc   this isn't a bad deal    punt allowed to bounce   sometimes the returner doesn't have a good play to make  either a fair catch or a return  so instead he just stays out of the way and the punt bounces mostly it bounces forward  good for the punting team  but sometimes backwards it   is    after all  an oddly shaped ball eventually the ball stops moving and it is awarded to the receiving team at the spot it stops moving or  if the punting team touches it  it stops there at that spot    punt returned   sometimes the returner catches the ball and runs it back    during a kickoff     kickoff into the end zone   if the kickoff ends up in the end zone  the ball still needs to be fielded by the receiving team but once they do the returner can  take a knee  and the ball is advanced to the 20 yard line  just like a punt into the end zone    kickoff through the end zone   this is the exact same result  only no kneeldown because it's impossible to field the ball in the field of play    kickoff returned   this is the only realistic other outcome  during a kickoff there is no fair catch but that s mostly because the defenders have a much longer way to run to get to the guy catching the ball during kickoffs  so there s less need to protect the guy and they never let the kickoff bounce  or if they do  they pick it up asap  because a kickoff is fair game for either team 
sort of two reasons  1 babies cry because this tells the parent something is wrong young children you can't really communicate clearly do the same thing  2 shocksurprise adults will do the same sometimes  given enough of either stimulus  just typically minus all the bawling 
if the ball hits the end zone or go past it  the receiving team automatically start on their 20 yard line the receiver of the ball makes a quick judgement on the people rushing at him and based on his perception if he can get catch the ball and run it past the 20th yard line if he can and there are no dangers of defenders forcing a fumble he would go for it  if he predicts the defenders will get to him too quickly  he might wave his arms indicating to everyone that it is a  fair catch   which is an agreement that he would attempt to gain more yards other than where he catches the ball  and in return the defenders wouldnt try to tackle him  if he doesn't go for the fair catch and he miscalculated and the defenders are closer than antipated  he might take the knee as soon as he catches the ball to end the play so he doesn't chance getting injured or fumbling the ball away 
the arm of the condemned is swabbed with alcohol before the needle is inserted along with its antiseptic use  the alcohol also causes the blood vessels to rise to the skin s surface  making it easier to insert the needle the needles and equipment used are also sterilized one reason for this is because the needles are standard medical products that are sterilized during manufacturing also  there is a chance that the prisoner could receive a stay of execution after the needles have been inserted as happened in the case of james autry in october 1983  he was executed eventually on 14 march 1984   finally  it would also be a hazard for those handling unsterile equipment 
atomic weights i don't know much about  but they seem to be weighted averages of what mostly are whole numbers  slight variance  pi is an irrational number  transcendental even   it has little to do with physical reality though  speed of light is a whole number  299 792 458 m  s this is precisely accurate this doesn't change  we've defined meter through speed of light  not the other way around the reason it's not 300 000 000 is probably because of legacy reasons meter itself is an arbitrary distance anyway  gravitational constant we don't know what it is exactly  as far as i know we know estimates and margins of error for that number  so you've grouped pretty different looking things on your list 
your chest cavity is basically a vacuum your diaphragm pulls on it from the bottom to make you breathe in getting the wind knocked out of you causes a spasm in the diaphragm that results in temporary muscle paralysis this paralysis is normal  and actually happens in most of your muscles but you really only notice it when it inhibits something important  like breathing same reason why your legs may lock up briefly after tripping 
same thing with swatting them out of the sky  does it have to do with surface area  do their bodies have structures to resist immediate strong impacts  but fail against sustained moderate forces 
when you squish it  you're squishing it  against  something  generally something big and hard with a lot of inertia the entire force you apply to it goes into  destructively  changing the shape of its body to be flatter whereas when you flick it  there s no extra resistance on the other side  only air resistance and the inertia of its own body  which are both tiny because air is thin and the insect is so small to begin with almost all the force you apply to it goes into accelerating it in the opposite direction  rather than changing its shape 

in addition to the other answers  it's worth noting that unlike in many other sports  colliding with your opponents is just bad strategy in rugby in a scrum  you lock shoulders with your opponents in a controlled manner in open play  you're typically trying to grab hold of someone who s trying to dodge you  which normally means going for the legs  and new rugby players are taught to aim for the legs or waist when tackling  a typical rugby tackle involves wrapping your arms around the opponent s legs and causing them to trip over your arms as a result   additionally  much less tackling goes on in rugby than in american football because you only tackle the person who currently has the ball  there s no blocking going on of the nonballcarrying members of the team  one of the rules of rugby is  approximately  that at all times you must either be behind the person carrying the ball from your team s point of view  or trying to get behind the person carrying the ball so the opponent carrying the ball is the only one that you can legally reach  the others are further back because they have to be behind from their point of view   and if your team has the ball  you can't tackle anyone 
due to the nature of the game rugby actually has way more rules and they aren't slamming each other head on 
wearing protective gear allows people to tackle each other with much greater force although the protective gear protects from the primary impact  your body actually ends up absorbing more concussive force i'll relate this to boxing  as i'm more familiar with it and can explain it better that way  something similar happens in fighting in you strike someone in the head with a bare fist  you will cause more surface damage  bruises  split eyebrows  etc maybe even broken bones however  if you hit someone while wearing a boxing glove  2 things happen 1  you hit harder  because there isn't much chance of injuring your own hand and 2  the cushioning doesn't disperse much of the force on the surface instead  that force is transmitted through the entire head with a hard enough hit  your brain will actually impact with the inside of your skull  possibly causing a concussion for this reason  boxing gloves are considered protection for the person wearing them  not for the person being hit  the same thing happens with football the protective gear allows you to actually deal more damage it protects the person who is doing the tackling moreso than the person being tackled 
you are making a very tiny photograph a cdr uses the same chemicals similar to what makes a bamp  w photograph when that chemical is exposed to light it changes  they've made sure this chemical is only very sensitive to very bright light of specific wavelengths  the writing laser   when it gets enough exposure it turns dark so that when it's hit with a lower power laser  reading laser  of a different wavelength  it won't reflect much light back while the areas that didn't turn black will reflect a decent amount of light back  rw s have a method by which they can be reset

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it's made using vegetables

i can be quite the show addict  and i've seen some great shows on food i'd love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it's hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it's a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did

when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i've ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely

treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it's about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you're familiar with new orleans  it's fun recognizing all the places if you've ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i'll eat the fish like a normal person
sorry if this is a stupid question i'm interesting in trying caviar  i've never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source

one black mole enchilada  one red mole enchilada  cured meat  spicy cured meat  chorizo and oaxaca cheese 

call it a broquet  bro 
i considered doing this but i figured i would butcher it 
you re hired
you also specialize in trichinosis i'm sure 
i love you 
 you're my clogged heart 

my first try using recipe  http  entertainingwithbethcomfoolprooffrenchmacaronrecipe
those tiny hamburgers look delicious

i was gon na say those look like huge caviar tins  then i discovered the half sized bottle of bubbly 
sorry if this is a stupid question i'm interesting in trying caviar  i've never had it can you recommend what i should try and where to purchase  are online retailers a good source 
thank god this was postvalentine s day because those foods would make for some very funky kissing 
you enjoy fish eggs i'll eat the fish like a normal person

orange blossom oil in the white chocolate ganache filling this is my 6th or 7th batch such a frustrating learning experience  a finicky pastry  indeed 
when macarons are baked the top shell layer of the macaron cooks and it means that the macaron can no longer expand and must rise up  this forms a frilled ruffle or foot that macaron has the most perfect feet i think i've ever seen no expansion out  just straight up seriously impressed and envious 
i ve never eaten a macaron what do they taste like   they look good 
always heard these were incredibly hard to make good job  a spot in my city makes the most delicious pistachio macarons i will have to try this on my own some day 
is there by chance a recipe  these look absolutely lovely 
wow  legitimately impressed only food i have tried and failed at and those look really well executed 
amazing footing
looks very tastey macaroons intimidate me though one day maybe i will try my hand at them
great  now i want a  filetofish   https  mcdonaldscomausitesmcdonaldscomaufileshero_pdt_filetofishpng 
now that took some skills those are perfect 
holy shit  gorgeous feet
it s beautiful 
nicely done  i will have to use that oven temp trick  often a portion of mine end up hollow but they still take decent pictures 

good for you   is that a desirable job 

hey look spaghetti 


this was my first time making pasta and it turned out really well the recipe is  100g allpurpose flower 1 large egg a pinch of salt  this is the guide i used to roll out and prepare the dough   https  wwwcooksillustratedcomfeatures8544howtomakehandmadepastawithoutamachine  it was a spur of the moment decision to make it  so i wasn't prepared with a good sauce or anything  but it turned out very good with some store bought marinara and ground turkey  finished product   http  iimgurcomwyem5hkjpg 
good job  would love to see it used in a dish
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
1 cat 2 cat 3 dog 4 cat 5 baby 6 baby cat 7 shrim fri ri  before getting butthurt and down voting this  it's just a joke 
does the cocaine add to the flavor 
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it's excellent 
hey  i'm looking for a cracker to use for canape  but i would really like one that isn't perfectly flat but actually is somewhat bowl shaped instead and around 12 inches wide  any suggestions of any that are worthwhile and available in the usa 
i actually found something that might work  some people sell mini fillo dough shells that might just do the trick 
that looks sooo good  making me hungry i'm going to do this next time i make pasta sauce 

make you own using mini muffin tray 
okay  welcome on board and nice compilation 
what cut is that  how many pounds  doesn't look over cooked  i like mine charred a bit more on the outside and a bit more raw on the inside it looks good  though  hope it was worth it 
looks awesome rib eye  how many ounces 
just tell me is it worth it and source please for science

why was this steak  63  lol
looks delicious
i thought that said used and i wondered where you got a used steak 
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
looks juicy shame it's cooked mediumwell 
you over paid by  50 
looks like it should be in a magazine
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
wow  this is some serious chili 

where your meat at bro 
yes  http  shesimmerscom201003quickandeasyrefrigeratorpickledasparagushtml i like this sliced red onions done this way too 

i made this gordon ramsay style didn't even think to take pictures until it was in the oven started wth the money shot  cuz everyone skips there anyway  i've never made beef wellington before i actually don't cook much  just followed the video on youtube it temped at 140 when i pulled it out for a solid medium rare served it with mashed potatoes and green beans  my wife was very happy 

and here i am eating from a bag of chocolate chips 
dear god i will be your valentine forever if you make me just one of these

hmm looks almost like a black salami
yum sure  if you had a valentine you could wrap them in bacon and cook them  but getting the cheese stuffing in would have been problematic so this is a win 
you did it right  my friend 
i made a seven layer salad and sat home in shame 
kfc for my valentine best yet  she didn't leave me after last night 
your feelings look delicious 
you re the winner here
i might have to try the stuffed mozz idea but i prefer crisped pancetta mixed into the loaf instead of the bacon  for my solo valentines i fried a chicken  made a beets  carrots  and goat cheese salad  and baked a buttermilk pie with booker s bourbon 
that actually looks really damn good  nice job  if you don't mind me asking  how did you make it  did you follow a recipe or is it your own twist 
my mind went straight to rpopping
ive made that meatloaf  but on the bbq grill comes out bomb 
this is easily one of the greatest things i've ever seen didn't over do the bacon  meatloaf looks moist  cheese iswellcheesing i bet this was heavenly i'd vote this for a top 100 perfect food god i can smell it 
 removed 
made a pan of walnut brownies with kahlua instead of water i'm single all mine 
this is very important so pay attention  i need a step by step preparation instruction and recipe now 
rketo
to be fair your feelings look delicious 
with cooking like that  you should be able to find somebody who likewise hasn't got a valentine  feed them  and wind up with a valentine that looks great 
why is it that i find all the super yummy food in the middle of the night 

looks tasty  for variation try mixing a shredded cheese with the meateggbread crumb mixture before forming mozzarella works  but these other cheeses work too  parmesan  various jack cheeses  pepperjack lt  3   cheddar  cabot makes a whole bunch of different kinds  most work and are good   and muenster that s all the cheeses i've used  anyway a mix of them can be good too  like both mozzarella and parmesan  also  if it ended up a little dry  try adding some finely diced onion i've made meatloaves with both onions and without  and i much prefer to have the onions in there unless i'm cooking for someone picky 
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 

hotter pan 
what s underneath the scallop  yumm
i almost made that   i decided on shrimp though  this looks great 

recipe  stir 2 eggs  a tablespoon of louisiana style hot sauce and 2 cups of butter milk in a mixing bowl salt and pepper chicken  and add to buttermilk mix and leave over night  or at least 1 hour   in another mixing bowl add 2 cups of flour  a tablespoon of each cayenne pepper  smoked paprika  chilli powder  granulated garlic  onion powder  thyme  salt and pepper  coat chicken once in the flour mix and shake off extra flour dip chicken in the butter milk again and repeat with the flour mix  i used vegetable oil  but can use peanut or a mix   fill dutch oven half way with oil heat til 350 degrees  f  and add chicken a few pieces at a time fry for 1518 til golden brown and reaches appropriate temp in a third mix bowl add 4 tablespoons of brown sugar  3 tablespoons of cayenne  one each of paprika  garlic powder and salt add half a cup of frying oil and mix well  coat chicken in hot oil sauce and serve 
do you eat the minifigures too 
can you share that slaw recipe  looks fantastic

that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i shouldn't have tried on valentine s day 
nice 


i usually don't like fish but i love scallops the problem is they're too pricey  is there anything i can buy that can take the place taste wise  trying to stay healthy 
i ve tried to bbq chicken and turkey drumsticks and both times i wound up with bones that broke super easy in my hand what was i doing wrong  i have an old grill that is primarily a smoker i got it up to about 180f and let the drumsticks go for a little under an hour until the internal temp was 165f i even tried baking the drumsticks first and then just smoking them at 125f which i read online was the correct temp but i always get super brittle bones what am i doing wrong  do you have any tips or a link 
lemon juice for scale
had a long layover in narita last year and went into town the unagi was really good  and there s a cool temple there too definitely recommend it if you have a 4 hour layover 
how do you feel about the other post that is claiming his brother made this  he posted a screen cap of an instagram  having a food related instagram cap gives his claim some sense of legitimacy everyone knows that is where the food posts are born 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
very nice  
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   

be less sad  and post recipe and pictures  loaf and crumb shots  to rbreadit  the positive comments should be somewhat uplifting 
time to get fat   d
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
now is this just a matter of making multiple thin layers and just stacking them 

http  wwwhaistreetkitchencom
mine are nutella chocolate spread and whole earth peanut butter
isn't that just a uncut sushi roll 
isn't that just a uncut sushi roll 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should 
two things you can not skip 12 hours  and the dutch oven if you want more intense flavor  try a starter they are fun pets to feed if you have the time kneed your dough or do what chad robertson does  a turn method i don't know the proper terminology  but if you do  there is a tighter shell around the bubbles giving the bread a better chew more gluten development if you look at the nyt video the bread has nice air bubble development  but like when my cousin makes it  large chucks will crumble around it i can not articulate it well  that being said  op  looks gorgeous

if anybody is interested  jim lahey made an updated version of his recipe cutting the fermentation time from 12 hours to 34 hours  http  cookingnytimescomrecipes1016271speedynokneadbread there is other ways of making the dough using olive oil instead of red wine vinegar  if anybody is interested http  wwwtbtamcom201207markbittmansspeediernokneadbreadhtml
looks great  as others have also mentioned  this is also known as the  jim lahey no knead bread   what i'd like to add is that his method of baking the bread dough in a cast iron works with virtually any bread dough  ie it doesn't have to be the  no knead dough    here are  two   http  imgurcomokj5wdf   examples   http  imgurcom1fy2bjl  where i baked different doughs in the cast iron pot  both of them with sourdough  wheat sourdough and rye sourdough   works great every time   
recipe 
you mean jim lahey 
it s actually jim lahey s recipe but it is super good his books my bread and my pizza are the best
hey man  i don't know the recipe you're talking about but i love your wooden cutting board  just beautiful 
really gorgeous 
alton brown published this recipe in 2008 i don't know if he was the first  but mark bittman certainly isn't  it's a great recipe regardless alton includes weight measures for the flour  should be more easily reproducible  http  wwwfoodnetworkcomrecipeskneadnotsourdoughrecipehtml edit  looks like lahey version was first  and published by mark bittman in 2006 the nyt intro does give attribution  i just didn't notice  and attribution isn't dated food network  on the other hand  does not give attribution to lahey 
i suggest everyone try making bread a couple times my first time was when i was very broke due to unemployment and whittling down all the miscellaneous items in my cupboard i found some generic yeast and also had a bag of plain old flour i didn't do the recipe quite right but after kneading for about 15 minutes i decided to give my concoction a shot anyways the results were remarkable granted  my local grocery store sells better french bread for four dollars per loaf  but this stuff was totally acceptable and probably cost me about 50 cents in ingredients i ate the whole loaf in a day and half  pushed along mostly by the smug satisfaction that i'd made it myself 
quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we're up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work   
this is the recipe that got me into baking bread  so yeah  it rocks 
that looks sooooo crunchy and satisfying 

nice food tasty food good for eyes  lungs  heart tasty  so sweet deliciuous  mouthful tasty crunchy  so pure grilled nicely  so sweet ribs please plant more trees  please plant them more 
bittman s  how to cook everything  is pretty much my bible i should give this a try 

how did you add the rosemary 

i can get onboard with this 
this is really good with something like a blackberry chipotle jelly 
i'm not sure about this

recipe 
man that is a deep dish like a barry white looks like a pizza cake 

though it's probably in your small intestine by now bon apetite 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts don't conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
yummy

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
recipe  insights and tips  been wanting to try my hand at croissants for a while anything to help avoid mistakes would be greatfully appreciated  edit  just saw in your xpost that your recipe was from america s test kitchen 
i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 

i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
gorgeous cook on that lamb  very nicely put together  
very nice 
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i'm on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome 
great job  that ramen looks perfect for a restaurant wall  did you use a black marker or black watercolour and a pencil for the details 
quite possibly the most outgregious false advertising ever the recipe lists 4 ingredients  but fails to list water so now we're up to 5  and you added 2 more  bring the grand total up to 233  as many ingredients than advertised  on the other hand  your results speak for themselves nice work

itssoraw
that is an awesome cutting board where did you get it from 
well now that i look at your username  i see it wasn't just my imagination have you ever wanted to disappear 
no crumbshot 
you had me at bacon 
are you sure you are going to eat that  with enough imagination you could make that loaf your valentine  no shame 
how are those arteries feeling 
no knead bread   what black sorcery is this 
i just made cajun shrimp and sausage alfredo glad i'm not alone in eating my feelings
no knead bread  i'm curious how does that work 
i made this over the weekend too  except now it's tuesday and it lost the crispy exteriorsolutions 
hello it's me  your valentine 
i d blow you just to try some of that and ima dude
ooh  that looks delicious  and nice  thick cuts of beef 
color looks great  but i've got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
not too sure about the cheese  looks like an abscess  otherwise the meatloaf looks absolutely amazing  before cutting into it it almost looks like a roast

i can be quite the show addict  and i've seen some great shows on food i'd love to hear what some of rfood s favorites are  here are some of the shows i really enjoyed  jiro dreams of sushi  i personally love sushi  it's hands down my favorite food this documentary revolves around jiro who has dedicated his entire life to perfecting his craft the art of making sushi  masterchef  my favorite of the many shows that follow the round by round elimination style i think the judging is pretty biased however  they seem to pick more for the audience and ratings than actual food  especially when it's a close race  iron chef  this show truly showcases people who have spent a large portion fo their life in the kitchen you watch two masters battle it out and put out some really creative and great look dishes also chef morimoto is a bad ass  shokugeki no souma  food wars   an animated  anime  series center around food battles if anime is your thing you ll probably enjoy it  i sure did 
master chef jr is the best 
treme it ended a few years ago but you can still find it on hbo online yes  it's about more than food  music  politics  corruption  etc in new orleans in the years after katrina  but the restaurants and chefs are a main thread of the show it has a ton of recurring chef cameos from john besh to willey dufry to emeril  just to name a few  and a lot of the kitchen dialog was written by anthony bourdain most of the show is shot on location  so if you're familiar with new orleans  it's fun recognizing all the places if you've ever worked in a restaurant  especially boh  i think you ll appreciate it 
i ve watched all those  maybe you'd also enjoy good eats and chopped if you don't already

they look excellent  croissants are truly a labor  but they are so good i've only made them a couple of times  but i have a hard time feeling motivated to do it again good job on letting them back to the proper color you see too many people afraid of getting a great deep color on their baked goods 
that is sexy af
wow  even perfect grill lines  kudos brother

vietnamese banh canh ingredients about 23 lbs of pork neck bones you can use ribs cut into individual bone pieces or asian style riblets as well why not both  about 6 quarts of low sodium chicken broth i cheated and used better than bouillon for this batch  3 large yellow onions  1 large ginger root  about 6 inches   1 large nugget of rock sugar or 2 tablespoons of regular sugar fish sauce to taste garnish 1 tablespoon annato seeds 12 cup vegetable oil thin sliced onions chopped cilantro chopped green onions fried onions directions bring pot of water to boil  add pork to the pot stir around for about 1 minute  remove ribs and rinse with cold water use your hands and rub away any scum that may still be clinging to the meat  add the ribs to a large stock pot  place the onions and ginger over a direct flame or under a broiler do this until they get blackened and charred flip and make sure the char is all over  add onions and ginger to the pot  add the chicken broth to the pot if you are using water and chicken bouillon  try to star with cold water  add the sugar to the pot  bring the pot to a low boil over medium heat  skim the surface of any scum that rises every 10 minutes or so do this for the first 45 minutes after that just skim if you see a lot of foam and crud at the top  let the pot sit just below a boil and reduce for around 3 hours meat should almost be fall off the bone tender  taste broth and add fish sauce if you need more salt add sugar if you need more sweet  prepare annato oil by putting the seeds and oil in a microwave safe bowl  cover bowl with a plate and microwave 30 seconds at a time the red color will leach into the oil stir around repeat for 30 additional seconds and stir once the oil has a good red color  scoop out the seeds  serving you should use vietnamese banh canh noodles for best taste they look like thick udon noodles you can also serve with vermicelli or rice swish the noodles in some boiling water until soft  drain and place in bowl add various pieces of meat to the bowl if you want  you can add cooked shrimp sliced in half as well as sliced cha ca or cha lua drizzle with a little of the annato oil garnish with onions  cilantro  green onions  fried onions and a squeeze of lime ladle the broth into the bowl

thank you for this 
my wife does the no knead bread too and i can't recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends 
looks like they ran out of steak and had to make a trip to the grocery store

i ve been wanting to have some caramel for my icecream  what is a good way to make caramel 
stick of butter  4 cups of sugar  melt together  ezpz
1 cup sugar  1 tablespoon corn syrup  14 cup water  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  12 cup heated heavy cream stir together the sugar  syrup  and water until the sugar is completely moistened heat  stirring constantly  until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling stop stirring completely and allow it to boil undisturbed until it turns a deep amber if you have a candy thermometer  use it if not  consider getting one it should reach 380  f immediately remove it from the heat and slowly and carefully pour the heated cream into the caramel it will bubble up furiously  use a hightemperature heatresistant rubber spatula  or a porcelain or wooden spoon to stir the mixture until smooth  scraping up the thicker part that settles on the bottom if any lumps develop  return the pan to the heat and stir until they dissolve stir in the butter wait a couple minutes and stir in the vanilla  you can store it at room temperature for up to 3 days and in the fridge for up to 3 months reheat it before using it  sorry about the format i'm on my phone enjoy  this recipe is truly awesome

nice you got some tail on valentines day 
i want to go to there
had lobster tails last night too was gon na go for the same presentation but got lazy and just boiled em up was delicious 
 rock  lobster  rockspiny lobsters are quite good  and possibly much more affordable but actual atlanticmainenorthern lobster is a completely different animal more succulent  better texture and flavor 
color looks great  but i've got some tips for the next time you grill some more tails  my first and best advice i could give you is for grilling any type of lobster tail  you ll want to cut it like a  wishbone   https  c7cf1aee0f9592118cd345a8e764187dff1857a6ffe8280848dcsslcf2rackcdncomuploadsimagescropped688_37453a357d1c3620_lobster  20tail  203  20v2jpg  this way you can grill the meat directly  facedown  without causing the tail to overcurl and avoid burning too much of the shell  if you are going to grill where the tails fluff out  be sure to pull down the sides of the tail  make small incisions if you have to  otherwise you ll keep ending up with that flared look  other than that  looks like you did an amazing job  hope they tasted as good as they look 
would you mind posting how you did it  last time i bbq d some lobster tails they came out kind of dry 
wahwah i think  i am going to try that thing  but where 
wow  that looks amazing well done 
some day i am going to put a couple shrimp on the barbie

very nice 
i am very upset at the lack of instructions and links here 

that looks great  mine was much more disappointing i shouldn't have tried on valentine s day 
you had me at lit fireplace  but the magic ball looks awesome  too   
as my grandfather would say   it will eat   
bravo if my husband did that for valentine s day  i'd be  super  impressed 
i'm wearing that exact same shirt   useless_but_true
looks amazing what did your wife say 
nice 
close enough lol
very nice  
what do you mean close enough  you fking nailed it
damn nice attempt  

i love lobster and grilling but am always scared to try grilling lobster in fear of ruining it do you grill it in shell  looks like the bottom is more charred then the top  is that side cooked down longer  average times 

you spent so much time wondering if you could  you never stopped to ask if you should 
isn't that just a uncut sushi roll 
looks amazing have you come across sushiritto  some of their stuff is awesome  http  wwwsushirritocomfoodsf
http  wwwhaistreetkitchencom
isn't that just a uncut sushi roll 

looks like it should be in a magazine
that looks amazing  but to say that you like it spicy would be an understatementholy crap 
wow  this is some serious chili 
try adding some corn to chili  fresh off the cob  adds that little sweet crunch  you put it in last looks freaking good  it was 40 here this weekend  i could of used a bowl of that 
i can already feel the burn  it fees so good
this is so awesome any recommendations for someone without a spice grinder 
man  this brings back memories of living in the fl keys and grilling lobster every night  during season of course 

carrot cake has always baffled me  it tastes good yet it's made using vegetables 
you can polish a turd 

i would enjoy hearing more about this dish 

why don't american s eat eel  in the south there are freshwater eels everywhere i wonder how they taste 
i like the wine glass any idea what it's calledwhere it's sold   also really like the look of the food  but the glass caught my eye  

crust recipe  please 
love for pizza
your wife looks like a dude
surprised this isn't in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
wasn't the original reversed  white chocolate ball with chocolate drizzle  yours looks better 
nailed it
idk dude that shit still looks pretty amazeballs kind of thing i'd expect from a restaurant 
upvote for effort op
pretty good clickbait title  if you're concerned about not having fillers  buy the bricks of parmigano reggiano they are expensive but it's one of those times where the difference is pronounced 
ok  you can't use the white chocolate as a sauce becuase the white chocolate is basicaly cacao fat  milk  sugar  vanilla  atleast a good one   so it melts at a lower temperature and has a much lower viscosity  while the dark chocolate has more cocoa solids so it tends to be thicker while a white chocolate ganache is more liquid at warm temperatures  if you want this to work right you need your ganache  a mixture of chocolate and cream  to have a certine thickness and creaminess which white chocolate does not have at the temperature required to melt dark chocolate  so tl  dr using dark chocolate ganache to melt white chocolate  gt  amazing  using white chocolate ganache to melt dark chocolate  gt  fucking disaster 
what did you do with the pork shoulder 

it looks great  you either went easy on the onion or you had one hell of a fine chop on them  i can only pick one onion piece out in the photo  also is that tvpveggie crumbles in there rather than meat 
nonmeat  then it is not a bolognese it is just sauce i mean it looks delicious but stop bullshitting us 
the best meat balls i have ever ate were called meet balls from a vegeterian restaurant in scotland
hey look spaghetti 
where your meat at bro 
is no one else seeing a chocolate death star  great job  op 

looks like it was cut from angels or unicorns 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
beautiful how did you prepare it 
portuguese food  the best  d
you forgot to cook it
that is the sexiest thing i have ever seen i'm leaving my girlfriend 
insane does coulotte have a lot of marbling 
 removed 
those look near perfect  nicely done a
yum 

a great way to perk up a dismal weekend we had such crummy cold weather this weekend in dc and this hit the spot 
sounds delicious
congrats  croissants are not easy  nor quick to make pro tip  you can make them  shape them  an then freeze them before you let them proof  rise  for weeks i used to snag frozen ones from my bakery and stash them in my freezer at home until the night before
i admire your patience baking can be such a pain  but really rewarding if it turns out tasty  then it's all the more validating for those hours of work you put into the food congrats   
i made it with the x on top  but i put it in a bowl so it imploded instead of opening like a flower 
you had me at meat tornado 
i clicked the thumbnail to inspect and boy i'm glad i checked here i salivate in this hypnotized state on rfood and i'm fully erect
oh wow that does actually look perfect
damn you  how hard are they to make compared to  lets say a choco chip 
can you show a picture of the inside of the macaron  the outside can be misleading as a novice macaron will be flaky inside the shell without this image  rfood can not tell if this macaron is good or garbage 

i love burger
cant beat the butter and honey butter and syrup are pretty good also  but that is practically pancakes at that point 
the third character in number 2 means brain  but i don't know the rest in that dish 3 is green pepper soft tofu fatty beef 4 is some kind of fish steamed in broth 5 maybe brown sugar glutinous rice 6 is also fish  7 is flavorful roast fish i'm not fluent  and some of the characters are too messytraditional for me

cream cheese and wheat thins 
i'm a little fuzzy on my mandarin but i believe the first one says  chengdustyle sauteed pork belly  i'm having difficulty with the others though sloppy handwriting 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
measuring cup   dude  you went this far and didn't think of every detail  
hah i did this too  i used 2 balloons and pieced together the two halves when i dipped the ballons the first time i felt that it wasn't thick enough to survive  so i put it in the freezer  cured it  then dipped it again  when i went to pour the hot chocolate on it didn't do a damn thing  my wife was sitting there like what s it supposed to do  so i panicked and just stabed it with a fork  annnnnnd the fork got stuck  so i had to walk to the kitchen and grab a knife  annnnd the knife got stuck too  so i just started beating the shit out of it with a big spoon when it finnally broke except it didn't just break  it fucking exploded everywhere  little chocolate prices went flying all over the room and melted in the freaking carpet  that god damn chocolate egg was a tank  the wife still appreciated the effort after i cleaned the carpets lol 
priceless  not sure if i fucked up  face
is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
why take out the seeds 
this is beautiful and pinteresty
i had a lot of fun painting food  and spent probably way too much time perusing rfood just for the references  thanks  umeatyelbow for getting these all together in one post 
i really like when men cook cupcakes 
i make it with goat cheese and put asparagus in it
needs to be more rare  looks juicy and delicious though 
recipe 
what did you do with the pork shoulder 
i always get my ratios off when making chili how much cumin did you use  and how big was the beef roast  do you use any other spices  or just the ground toasted cumin and dried chili powder 
why take out the seeds 
your feelings look delicious 

the bbq in the second picture  that looks amazing 
those pickled red onions though ugh  so good love them with bbq and had them with the best lobster roll ever 
i love bbq
brisket is my fantasy food i've never lived anywhere that had a place that was known for cooking it all the barbecue places around me only care about pork

home team bbq in charleston sc is amazing if you're ever this way

the most delicious way to develop colon cancer

gt  don't lick the screen  don't tell me how to live my life 
found my soulmate 9 years ago we literally made something just like this  but with fresh feta instead   moral of the story  true love tastes like ground beef stuffed with savory cheese  wrapped in bacon  where do you think the term  fat and happy  comes from 
i too use a henkel breadknife to cut meat 
since no one commented on it  i love henkel knives good taste my friend 
how are those arteries feeling 
seriously  to me  this is the most delicious food picture i ever seen  perfect cook on the meat and it looks so amazingly juicy 
the internet has ruined me 
i bet if you steam it  the meat will hold on to more flavor from the spice rub looks delicious either way  though

i licked it

i hate meatloaf  but that soundslooks amazing 
gt  the spices what spices we must know

title could be the name of a fall out boy song

you have a gift  i'd look at some culinary schools if i was you 
surprised this isn't in the comments already how would you prevent this  colder chocolate ball  really hot sauce 
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
jim lahey  i have been making this for over 5 years now and from what i understand the original recipe from mr lahey was in the ny times in 2006 if you search google you can find quite a few variations   jalape  o cheese   http  wwwalaskafromscratchcom20140314jalapenocheddardutchovencrustybread  is my favorite  i wfh so i make a loaf every few days 
definitely get back into a proper kitchen asap  even if it's a diner or something like that  anything that allows more leeway than fast food  you're talented 
ah nothing says classy like pyrex 
well there s no knead to brag about it 
i like your knife set  we have the same one
the second dish actually warmed my heart with all that ciabatta and cheese and warm tomato oh god
 removed 

i would gladly trade you my so for that meatloaf
my wife does the no knead bread too and i can't recommend the book  flour  water  yeast  salt  enough it took her bread to the next level  things she does different though she mixes everything in her kitchenaid stand mixer and then proofs the bread in the oven by turning it on to 200c for 1 minute  maybe 2 if your oven is older   puts a shallow dish with hot water on a lower rack and then puts the mix in on a higher rack it proofs in 2hrs usually versus the 812hrs the noknead receipies recommends

is it just me being stupid or that looks almost exactly like in the original post 
my only critique is that you poured from too high up get the sauce very hot  and pour low you lose a lot of heat as it travels through the air and you get some splash when it lands  so you don't get as clean of a cut through the ball 
love it  i just saw how to do that the other day too can't wait to try it out

whered ya catch em 

this is what my dreams are made of did you make the harissa from scratch  how did you prepare the sprouts 
being from the uk  brussels sprouts don't conjure up the best imagery in most brits minds but this looks really fresh and flavourful 
you make sandwiches  we get it 
damn this could make me go vegan 
yummy
i need to know as i have a craving that needs satisfying tomorrow i want to try it in a new way though as i only ever have cheddar on a ritz cracker throw in whatever you like  as long it's excellent 
kind of more complex but my favorite is baked brie  with blueberry preserves  on water crackers 
extra sharp cheddar  gouda  romano  a nice blue or brie put it on a wheat thin or stone mill cracker or slice up a baguette in 14  pieces and toast them in the oven with some olive oil and garlic 
swiss on a triscuit is the shit those triscuits tear my mouth up tho 
wheat thins with extra sharp cheddar and guava
cream cheese and wheat thins 

that s a ton of cookies 

i love burger

that is awesome  thanks 
that tom cruise s character  john anderton  kidnaps the precog agatha in a pool  mirroring his own son s kidnapping  which was also by a pool  there is also the irony in that he joined precrime to stop incidences like his son s kidnapping yet he resorts to kidnapping afterwards in order to prove that the system he worked so hard to develop was wrong  great movie 
dear god that was one of the most incredible movies i've ever seen  going into it i knew only a few things that it takes place in world where women have become infertile and one woman has become pregnant  clive owen must guide her to safety there s a long take in a car and julianne moore gets shot yeah  it sucks that that part got spoiled for me but i was in shock it happened so early on in the movie but i had no idea that this film would be so incredible  every performance was incredible  not a single weak one the cinematography is some of the greatest i have seen and was honestly better than lubezki s in the revenant every single shot was filmed so incredibly and had me sucked in and dear god that long take when theo is navigating the city at the end was one of the best tracking shots i've ever seen overall any small flaws i may have with this movie in subsequent watches will be overshadowed by everything else being perfect one of the best movie s i've ever seen  1010  just one question though  what really was the fishes true motives  did they want the baby to survive or not  and what did they want to do with it  i'm a little confused there 
when i saw it in theaters i knew absolutely nothing about it until my friend told me a basic plot outline  like  people can't have kids anymore  and distinctly remember thinking  god this movie sounds so stupid  and then being blown away like you  it does such a good job  especially with the long takes  of showing you that there is this big apocalyptic story going on  and you're just watching one piece of it but yeah  back in 2007 that s what the end of the world would of looked like
i watched this movie first when i was 78 i fell in love with it then and i keep finding more and more things in the film to love it's personally one of my favorite spielberg films 
that entire scene the camera stays inside the car that s a huge part of what makes it so effective no bird s eye view or sweeping shots of the incoming motorcycles you have the same limitations on what you can see as the people inside the vehicle and feel as trapped as they do  gravity a few years later just cemented it further for me i love what alfonso cuar  n does with the camera 

rip george gaynes wherever you are  we hope there s a podium just the right size for you to stand in front of

what a wonderful movie 


imagine someone sending this to leo and he spends days playing it unable to catch to oscar 
agreed wholeheartedly this movie is why  frankly  i was kind of disappointed with gravity  which was also directed by alfonso cuaron   technically gravity is breathtaking but is still this spacestation hopping modern tale of survival children of the men  on the other hand  is a fictitious world working on this fantastic premise that still works why  it's because it seems to effortlessly saturate us with little things to suggest that this world exists the religious protesters  the ringing in his ears  the family portraits around the room  to answer your question about the fishes i think it was best left ambiguous to pin it to a simple answer  i think they wanted the baby to live and for them to prey upon the blind desperation of the world on the other side of the coin cinematically  think about the little girl in waterworld she is presented as symbol to acquire control in a postapocalyptic world 
i ve realized that the timeline makes zero sense the movie is intertwined with the events of  the bourne ultimatum  which in itself was directly intertwined with   the bourne supremacy  both of those films presumably take place in 2004 matt damon recently made comments that confirm that timeline  the problem begins when we see that renner s character  died  in 03 at the age of 25 this was when he entered the outcome program  so  either renner is an incredibly poorly aged 26 year old with one year of experienceor they fucked up

rififi has one of the best actual heist scenes

yes  very fine film kurt russell is the man and matthew fox even gave a good turn really not a weak performance in the whole movie 
this movie will go down in history because of one scene  the rest of the movie is decent  but that scene cements this movie forever in history as a must watch

not a huge kubrick fan  so i'll go with tarkovsky  or perhaps antonioni  i thought i'd get called pretentious for thinking this  any film you haven't watched can be pretentious if you want it to   but the comments in this thread are actually pretty diverse and interesting  from hitchcock  to chabrol  to rohmer  to ozu  even tony scott got some love  so i think i'll be fine

honestly even though it wasn't very good  i enjoyed it a lot i'm sure i'll watch it on netflix or something glad they're making a second one  it was unique and well acted at least 
the first one was meh and the twist was obvious like 5 mins into the film why they would make a second one or where the story would even go is beyond me and i guess they couldn't spring the extra bucks for john cho

gt  he was kind of a oneoff gag  but anger would punch fear and schadenfreude would see it and just go   in a german accent   ha  ha  ha  your pain amuses me   that s hilarious i hear the voices of the nihilists from the big lebowski in my head doing that line speaking of which  didn't flea do a voice in inside up 
would like to hear other opinions on this film it was so raw and well written everything about the movie felt so genuine and real highly recommended for anyone who has not seen it 
this is in my amazon queue as a fan of westerns  kurt russel  and genrebending horror  i have no excuse for not having seen it 
i dont think you need a backstory alien is imo the greatest scary movie of all time  aliens is a top 3 greatest action movie of all time both at classics  but they stand alone well enough so the order doesn't matter
rohmer and ozu 
i really hope it wins the oscar for animated feature film

that movie really hit home for me it's kind of scary how similar my life is to that of the characters in that movie sometimes great performances all around  and baumbach really knew what he was doing when it came to writing and directing

yes 
i'm confused  why not show him alien  why start with the second one at all 

it s on netflix now and i've just got ta say it blew me away how did this movie only make 18 million in the box office  i put this movie on at 12 to fall asleep too but i couldnt it had me so engrossed in story that i had to see it to the end it's one of the few movies i've seen recently where i genuinely cared about the characters and felt like i could relate to them on a personal level  if you haven't seen it yet please do yourself a favor and watch it 
not on my favorite film of 2015 but its in my top 20 movies my favorite comedy film from the 2015 though 
yes i saw aliens first i loved aliens then i tried to watch alien  and did not enjoy it as much as aliens i thought the pacing of alien was too slow i did not even finish watching alien the first time i watched it i finished watching alien many years later now i like alien better than i did  but i still like aliens more than alien 
i started with alien it introduces the antagonist  gives loads of backstory that leads up to aliens  character development for ripley  etc  etc he would have a general understanding of the androids and a better understanding of bishop and his role in the film i'd just recommend watching them in order 
i think aliens is a great stand alone movie  but i think seeing alien afterwards would make you not like the first one as much you could enjoy both more  total metric happiness units  if you watch them in order 

the trailer that aired in the theater before the force awakens was awfulall they had to do was show sloths working at the dmv  boom  that s the punchline  joke over but they took that joke and drove it into the ground with a fiveminute scene of  the  sloth  talking  really  slowly 
i hate zoo topic and i haven't even seen it too many freaks of the furry community and the movie itself seems to invite these people i don't care i won't see it
that s how i first saw it worked ok  but i was also 12 and was just psyched to watch a badass r rated movie 
this is why i never use imdb 43rd all time  pffh it's good  but let's not go crazy 
honestly at this point i don't really mind hearing about ridiculous imdb top 250 list things it's not a great source but i do think it's a solid list for watching entertaining movies i think the majority of the movies on the list are movies that practically everyone can enjoy more prestigious  lists might have  better  movies  but the imdb list is supposed to reflect the general audience so i think it does an alright job 
dae critics are stuck up and don't know what fun is    
i don't think so  as long as you give your friend a quick backstory to the first movie  aliens stand on it's own 
i loved the film  but i really wish it had a better ending the third act just felt scattered the last 5 min worked though

completely surprised with how this movie s turned out  the more footage i've seen  the more interested i've become in the storyline and characters  it's a shame that first trailer was so vague as to what the movie was actually about  since i think there d be more buzz surrounding  zootopia  now if they'd done otherwise 
nice it ll be interesting to see how the writers and reed go this time with a lot more time and freedom to create exactly what they want a lot of the ideas they brought to the first after wright left were awesome

 drive in movie critic  joe bob briggs had a formula for how to make a successful sequel   the first rule of all drivein sequels  make the same damn movie you made the first time   and while he meant it in jest  there is a strong statement in there about making  any  movie sequel  so make a list about what was truly great about the original blade runner so many things  the great model of los angeles  worth a travelogue as a city of the future  the culture of the place with giant pyramids and smokestacks belching pollution and airships and flying cars  totally original music  not just space travel  but space war  capitalist androids and megacorporations  etc  etc  there is also the downside of filth and decay  great and small details like the dust on top of bryant s ceiling and a run down version of the idiosyncratic bradford building  the end result is a truly breathtaking and majestic movie a complete world what parts of that can both be reproduced in a sequel yet be made novel enough to grasp the imagination  for a plot  you need villains in this case  the more  the merrier nexus7s and perhaps nexus8s  running amok

am i the only one who thinks  targeting  a rating is bullshit to begin with  if you're making something  why force a limitation on yourself or force additional content if it doesn't benefit the product 
i did not see why they needed a blade runner sequel  but the more they released about who s attached to the film the more i got excited about it 
yeah  there are a lot of unpopped popcorn kernels to chew on in that list 
should have included american psycho 2 and s darko 
what  it's not out yet  i saw that movie 6 months ago 
i didn't really liked the first one  but this one definitely has my attention did they started filming 
that just goes to show you how far fan service will go really loved deadpool 
i get what the article is trying to say  but blade runner 2 is a weird way to start off a discussion about forgotten sequels villeneuve is directing  ridley scott producing  roger deakins is doing the cinematography  one of the original screenwriters is writing the screenplay again and ryan gosling is the lead i would say that it should be one of the most anticipated movies  nothing compared to the sequels listed 
one sequel i really  really hated was  clerks 2   it's one of the only movies i have seen in the theater and walked out on before it was over it was just that bad to me normally i like kevin smith but i just got this vibe like the whole thing was so fake and it bothered me especially because i think one of the things i liked best about the original  clerks  was how authentic it felt 

in my next life  if i am a producer or director  i vow never to make a sequel to any movie or to participate in any franchise if you think of how many sequels are overwhelmingly disappointing it brings down our regard for most franchises there is really only a very small handful of satisfying sequels  i am not referring to serials  such as harry potter  but to sequels  those movies that get made as an afterthought because of an initial success  it is predictable that a sequel will be disappointing that it is boring to even think about it 
it s one of those movies where i saw the trailer and thought   i would honestly prefer redhot knitting needles in my skull 
it s really good   i like way they told the story 


this was an excellent film 
looks like a solid action film but it also seems to be using a lot of common tropes andor cliches  eg charming crim and grizzled cop team up  display of skills in an  i'm that good  manner  the clearing of the van  and  of course  the  if you do this you are on your own   with an elevator one liner to top it off   maybe that s just the way the trailers edited though  and hey  elba looks bad ass 
i will never get tired of seeing idris elba smash things 
idris deserves better  guy is a great actor but they keep giving him lame action roles 
  why did you run     have you seen yourself  
the title made me think of a large cast  multi story  holiday movie like  love actually  or  new year s eve 
can't wait to see this 
couldn't even watch the whole trailer looks like generic copgangshootemupviolence move booooooooo 
this doesn't seem like a good film  1  bad performances 2  worse american accents 3  what is everyone s fascination with elba  is it a black thing  like  i'm not a racist  i like idris elba   because he's in a lot of stuff but he's not really that good  imho 
what if we just get ride of the current rating system  i propose a score based on 4 points language  sexual content  violence  and substance abuse will be each scored from 1100  then an average would be found that movie would then have a maturity content score similar to how rotten tomatoes score their films  this way  we can include more gray area score  instead of the 4 basic groups studios can also mess with the formula to try and get a lower score  cut more language and add more violence  
i gave it thirty minutes but it was too boring did i need to see the first 
the first is enjoyable the second one was cluttered 
as good as inside out was  it was very limited in that sense people experience more than 4 emotions
fuck i have to say  the trailer doesn't make the film look good the accents are ropey  the shots are uninteresting and clich   the dialogue sounds rote and formulaic  the pickpocket gimmick seems oversold and unnecessary  the setpieces all look like they've been cobbled together from other films  the music was dull  and i feel like i've seen 80  of the film  and i still have no idea what the actual plot is it feels like a fake trailer from a tv show or something goddamit  why can no one use idris elba right 
should have made it about aliens

edit  if you can tell me a little bit about the movie that would be nice thank you  and i really mean stuff that makes me want to question why i'm tormenting myselfi don't shed a tear that easy  also since i'm asian i prefer dramasactually just give me the saddest shit you can think of  edit2  thanks a lot for all the replies so far i started out with hachi for nownothing tearjerking atm next on the list is planestrains and automobiles

inside out
interstellar made me bawl and i do not cry often it can be a bit confusing  but if you don't overthink it you ll be fine basically  a man has to search for a new planet for humanity to live on and leaves behind his daughter  and son but nobody cares about him  to go on this journey  also  about time a man tells his son that the males in the family can travel through time so the son goes through his life and starts a family and such but then it gets really sad not at all sciif  i know it sounds like it  but really it isn't  but very much adorable romance and i usually hate romances

this may just be me personally  but i tend to get more choked up at extremely emotional and touching moments  than incredibly depressing ones  in movies   the ones that are coming to mind for me right now are field of dreams and it's a wonderful life the ends of both of those movies hit me pretty hard 
it s a wonderful life the film demonstrates  quite beautifully  the meaning of human existence the final scene will spur extremely strong emotions down side is it's a black and white film  but up side is it's the best i've ever seen

who the fuck keeps making all these trailers that show every major plot point in the movie 
i d love idris elba to be the next bond he's got such swagger and stage presence 
this looks like one of those shitty luc beeson produced films but it's directed by james watkins who i think of as a great director based on his previous work confused and intrigued

i thought the article hit on a lot of interesting points  but didn't put enough focus on a major difference between the original novel and the two films based on it that would make any adaptation of the source material a challenge beyond the difficult subject matter that make any attempt to adapt the novel hard  an issue which the article explores with aplomb   a big part of what made lolita a superior novel is nabakov s incredible writing  and that s almost inevitably lost in a visual medium  sure  there s a lot of worthwhile thematic material to be gleaned from the plot alone  but so much of what makes the plot tolerable is that nabakov puts you inside the head of a monster  that it's an examination of what makes someone like humbert tick and the twisted filter through which he sees the world even if a movie adaptation could survive the loss of nabakov s prose  it's always going to be on the outside looking in when it comes to humbert and his deviance  and that removes the ambiguity and distance between how humbert sees himself and the actual horror of what he does  which  to my mind  is the sharpest and most incisive part of the source material 
i have some qualms with movies you left off  but i won't hold you to it because it's a really well done video and everyone is entitled to their own opinions gave me a greater appreciation of what 2015 had to offer   also  can't wait to see the witch 
this is  to me  the best 2015 summary video i have seen so far this was fantastic and honestly about made me cry job well done 
i found  twelve monkeys  to be pretty fucking depressing 
 the notebook   blue valentine  both are love stories   schindler s list   more horrifying than sad  but sad nonetheless 
glad to see  it follows  on the list easily my favorite horror film in over a decade  maybe more 

i really think this is well made  but i do have a question about what you consider qualifying in the year 2015  because the entire thing is made up of movies that received a 2015 limitedwide release date in the us and includes movies that premiered in 2014 but didn't get until 15  ie  the look of silence    but then we get two movies that have yet to be released in the states at all   the witch  and  the lobster   so are you just going by what year you saw it rather than the actual release date of the film 
pulp fiction  marvin  he got shot 

we are meant to focus on and learn about the main characters of the story  but sometimes if you pay close attention to people in the background  or even to the ones who just have minor roles  their stories can be just as interesting who are these characters

john seale technically shouldn't be on this list he came out of retirement for mad max i assume he's going back to it he is in his 70 s
i'm surprised wally pfister isn't on this list his work on tdk trilogy and inception was amazing 
glad to see robert richardson here i loved the photography in hateful eight  and felt it used 70mm to its full potential even thought it was mostly set in that cabin

this excellent indian movie called  the lunchbox  always cheers me up 
 it  s great to get a grammy after being nixed for an oscar   he said  so i wanted to thank this academy  rather than the other one  because i don't  have anything to thank them for  bringing up his oscar loss while receiving another award reeks of pettiness and entitlement perhaps if he'd been in the industry longer  he'd realize that snubs  using the word lightly in this case  are common and relatively inevitable  given the small number of scores chosen and the strict guidelines for eligibility

for me it would be studio ghibli movies  exept maybe grave of the fireflies   after watching their  possibly  final film  when marnie was there i was brought to tears  but still was happy at the same time what movie  s  do that for you guys

drummer here and kind of a cinema snob  definitely a music one   birdman s soundtrack is really incredible you have to give credit to how accesible  enjoyable  yet proficient the drum sections are  similar to what made the best prog rock in the 70s  being able to please the casual listener and the techniquehunter alike

using the famed  and recently updated   tspdt top 1000 list   http  wwwtheyshootpicturescomgf1000_all1000films_tablephp   i did this fun little project to give some perspective on what critics with hindsight and a wider variety of films believe were the best of the year  just a note  this is from a critic poll  so if you get angry about these choices  they were'nt made by any specific critic and you can't really get angry at critics as a whole  because lists like this don't take into account how much some critics hated the film  only how much others loved it so keep the anger inside  and

2012  so everything beyond that is kind of a mystery in where it stands among film canon if a film isn't apart of film canon yet  it has no chance of making the list expect film canon to slowly catch up in the years leading up to the next sight and sound poll in 2022  where everything will thankfully be refreshed 
i decided to exclude short films  so stuff like la jetee  night and fog  and meshes of the afternoon didn't make the cut that s a thread for another time   also  the life of pablo happened anyone excited for bottomless pit 
i don't know if i can trust a list void of saving private ryan
the only thing about this list that makes me sad is all of the japanese movies that would  should  have won 
could someone cross reference this with the list of actual winners  how many did the academy actually get right 
hey this is super cool  thanks  edit  also thanks a lot for adding the director name thanks to the movie 
i want to mention that these lists of greatest movies by critics sometimes miss a shitload of awesome movies this is a great list  but if you follow it and it alone  and other such lists  you are bound to miss a whole lot of amazing cinema but that goes without saying  but i wanted to just remind people of that for example  im sure there is no john carpenter movie on this list  but his movies are some of my favorites  woah  just did a search for him and the thing shows up  waddya know but anyways  still true that a lot of cool shit will not show up on such lists in other words  they dont cover everything 
avatar is the only and only movie that should be on this list still the only movie i've seen in 3d where it didn't seem like a gimmick 
 hugo   scorsese nailed it no gimmicky shots  just amazingly immersive cinematography 
avatar since it was shot in 3d still haven't seen anything like it 
life of pi
tron legacy was also shot using a 3d camera and not converted from a 2d print
prometheus was so good in 3d  adventures of tin tin 
dredd

good guy  typically old friend but not always  introduced in the first 10  of the film don't see him again until the last 10  where it turns out he's the evil mastermind 
63
based on the most recent trailer  75

 whisper of the heart  its just such a beautiful and sweet movie 
i'm going to be positive here   78 
thank you for doing this  we need more of this type of original content  anyone looking to starting exploring film more could use this list as a template obviously some years are better than others  looking through  1960 and 1966 are particularly unbelievable   but as an initial frame of reference this is a superb resource 
evil dead 2 with commentary on  sam raimi  bruce cambell  scott spiegel  and some other dude   it's really funny  and especially interesting to hear if you're a fan of the movie or the people behind it 

these final hours was surprisingly very entertaining a dark  unique  and realistic seeming twist on the apocalypse 
meh thanks for submitting but list overall was underwhelming some solid films but some that aren't that good surprised not to see incendies or the lives of others 
no eraserhead or any other lynch movie 
snowpiercer didn't really do much for me i mean some of the revelations at the end were kinda fucked  but aside from that the movie was kinda boring i couldn't figure out what the hype was all about to each his own 
i still haven't gotten over   reading   about  audition  
city of god saw it one time and haven't been able to watch it again since 

66
saw the title and thought  that had better be oscar micheaux 
i'm hoping for something in the 80s

the del toro casting is old news but i'm curious about dern and this newcomer chick also holding out for that tatiana maslany rumor from a while ago 
i love laura dern i hope i'm not the only one excited for this 
laura dern  rey s mom calling it 

here are some of my picks  gravity  mad max  fury road  resident evil  afterlife  final destination 5  a very harold amp  kumar 3d christmas  oz  the great and powerful
i really want it to be aroud the 80s  but since life isn't perfect  i'm expecting a 72 waitif life was perfect  it would ve gotten a 100right  fantasies

del toro s gon na play poe dameron s brother  bro dameron
never seen perfume  but did read the book the ending of that book was probably the weirdest thing i've ever read 
benicio del toro is going to show up at the end of the movie as  the collector  to unite the star wars universe with the marvel universe   
scott pilgrim vs the world  although its a graphic novel adaptation  to get a girl he's head over heals for  scott pilgrim must defeat her seven evil exes all the while learning a lot about himself and relationships in general 
film that got stuck in my head for a while  which was completely unexpected  was sicario it captured the morbid reality of cartels really well  the movie reminded me of a disturbing article that was on reddit a while back was something along the lines of  kid thrown off a bridge by gang members because the kid refused to do what the gang told him to do  kill the driver of the next bus that comes along    all because his father was a bus driver 
grave of the fireflies i feel this one should come with a warning though it absolutely destroyed me 
watched sunshine  2007  for the first time last week  can confirm still stuck with me and about to watch again 
did you also notice that anderton escapes the police spiderbots by  hiding  in a tub of water  or that the  mystery murder  that is the crux of the narrative is a  drowning   or that in the first precog vision of murder  the bathroom water in the tub overflows  stained red with blood  or that anderton s holographic home movies of his son take place on a  beach   other than the constantly repeating imagery of  eyes   water is the key image in the film including the fact that the precog sanctuary home at the end of the film is seen to be    beside a lake    
the amazing spiderman 2 i know its not the best movie like avatar and such being great but this one really took 3d to a new level for me
snowpiercer was terrible 
i'm on mobile can somebody list what the films are 
perfume is probably one of my favorite movies so glad to see it here 
much as i love both actors  i think star wars is more enjoyable when they cast unknowns 
anyone else get to the end of into the wild and just think  he's an idiot 
you sort of missed out requiem for a dream tbh stays in your head for a good week or so

sorry for the delay on this one  there was too big of a range for the estimations because of the 4day weekend so i decided to wait until today for reference here s the domestic top 5 from frisun  1 deadpool   132434639 1 kung fu panda 3   19755738 1 how to be single   17878911 1 zoolander 2   13841146 1 the revenant   6525668
i think it's time to write zoolander s eugoogoly 
apparently zoolander 2 is worse than the holocaust i'm thinking of going to see it just to see how bad it is 
heart of the sea really didn't last that long  did it they're sunk the fact that kfp 3 is still hanging on as well as it is  great  and there s still no other kid s competition   that matters   until zootopia 
i'm glad z2 is tanking hard lazy cash grabs deserve to bring a loss for the studios greenlighting garbage exclusively because it has brand recognition when that money could have went to something new 
absolutely incredible weekend it's so much fun  as a box office junkie  to see a movie like this blow everyone s expectations out of the water  it's going to perform very well next weekend as well  i wouldn't be surprised if it makes another  6070 million then  which is what many analysts were predicting for this weekend  
the best thing about deadpool for me was colossus i used to collect xmen way back in the day and he was my fav character they did him absolutely great in the movie compared to the other shitty versions of him 
saw deadpool it deserves  1 then after i saw sw  tfa for the 5th time because i saw a sign for it in line for deadpool 
on friday i looked at the local alamo drafthouse website and they were only showing it on one screen  and it was booked pretty much the whole day by saturday it went to 2 screens now  i don't know if that was already planned or not  but both screens were booked near solid the whole time through yesterday i finally went and saw it today as it was a normal work day for everyone else  the local cinemark was also booked solid the amc didn't say online or show seats so i don't know  however it's usually busy anyways as its in a mall so i have to assume it was booked solid too 

domestically  risen will do okay due to the builtin christian and especially evangelist audiences  internationally  christian films generally do not do well the major asian markets obviously do not care for christian films china  currently the second biggest movie market in the world after north america  does not even allow christian movies into their market europeans  who have become very secular people  are not crazy about christian films either  that is the problem with christian movies  it really does not have much of an international markets and nowadays the international markets are so much more important than just the us market so movie studios really need to think hard before they greenlight the next christian movie 
i also noticed an interesting parallel between john and the man behind the murder as  both wearing shirts at the time  
oldboy http  wwwimdbcomtitlett0364569
awesome  thanks op  i have been meaning to watch snowpiercer  but never realized it was on nextflix us 


this is great if this was a thing back in 2013  deakins would have won for skyfall 
complementing vfx have always been part of the game  why change it now 
isn't there the problem that the academy doesn't want to add any more awards because of how hard it would be to fit into the tv slot  i remember that that s why they haven't added a stunts category despite the fact that they've been trying for years 
good then maybe a film like inception won't rob true grit 
give the people what they want pretty simple hollywood 
thank you for taking the time and effort making this list for us lazies to read  

what is this even about 
luke evans looks like a poor mans michael shannon 
illuminati detected 
this is like one of these movie posters you'd see at the rental place in the 90 s and as a kid there d be such a mystique about  that it was unbearable because you know you're parents will never let you see it 
the international trailer is fantastic i worked hard to find the music  data kiss by com truise  i hope it's as good as it looks in the trailer it reminds me  the way it looks  of nicholas roeg s the man who fell to earth 
clockwork  orange   https  nonamemovieblogfileswordpresscom201204clockworkposterjpg 
just finished the book a couple weeks ago if the movies got half of that stuff in it it's gon na be a such a fucked up flick it's almost the darkest comedy ever written but is just too fucking creepy and maybe possible 

well  ryan reynolds  it took you a few tries with comic book movies but ya done good ya done damn good 
he should ve gotten an oscar for it 
the fuck    zoolander 2 is out   
yes please 
these types of numbers make you wonder if producers are finally going to realize that releasing shit sequels for popular comedies just doesn't bring in as much money as making quality content when will they learn 
you said international earnings for deadpool might be high due in part to lax standards in canada  but canada revenues are counted in the domestic box office 
i wonder how much ryan s take will be on this becuase he deserves every last penny 
it s an unpopular opinion  but how bout we stop with the awards altogether  instead of art being an excuse to fellate each other and ourselves  we can just let it stand or fall on its own merits  each award ceremony is yet another reminder that 999  of movies exist only to make a buck 
waitzoolander 2 is out    this is genuinely the first time i'm hearing about it premiering 
i love pd james she's the writer try some of her detective novels sucked me in the same way 
i just tried to watch this for the 2nd time today  all sold out i went to two theatres and the tickets were gone this movie s raking in some serious cash 
more than all the rrated hype  i think this movie could trigger the return of midrange budgets these days  everything is a sub  15 million budget indie type project that hopes to strike gold or its a  150 million blockbuster deadpool proved that studios can take a risk on more outthere projects and good directors can make them profitable 
not saying they shouldn't but making the oscars longer with more categoriesnot the ideal scenario 
whoa  whoa  whoa  if we are going to set up a new category at the oscars how about we focus on female representation in the director category the boys club that is the oscars has to come to an end  as a women s studies graduate and amateur film maker the glass ceiling in film is not only ever present but systematically telling young women everywhere that film is not for them how about reddit check its priviledge and stop trying to advance the status quo of the patriarchy
fuck yeah  jeremy s iron 
just because of that trailer  highrise easily became one of my most anticipated films of 2016 
its looks similar to the kingsmen poster
about to go on a 17 hour flight to visit family and i'd appreciate some suggestions on what to watch to pass the time 
lord of the rings 
 catch me if you can  interstellar  forrest gump  the terminal  back to the future  inception  into the wild  silver linings playbook  that should make for 17 hours of flight time  important note  just be sure to watch inception last it's ending works great on your situation 
i d got to one of two extremes i'd either try to mix up my selection so i could alternate between a drama that i'd really get something out of and a comedy just to kill time  or i'd download all the movies from one franchise and have a marathon i've been meaning to do the original five planet of the apes movies in one sitting for a while  so that s my suggestion 
i like bridesmaids there is just something about that flight scene while on a plane i annoy the shit out of people with my laughing 
try to knock out some trilogies or series maybe a miniseries cornetto trilogy is nice if you haven't seen it and maybe a show like fargo  true dectective  the americans if you want some drama 
a seven nation army couldn't hold tom hiddleston back 
 this poster   https  pbstwimgcommediacz95ywpwiaeqgw_jpg  large  for highrise is also gorgeous i love how it's a reference to crash too 
oldschool style great poster 
this is one of my favorite novels i'm not sure how it will translate to film  but i hope it's great 
reminds me of a clockwork orange probably a very different movie heh
nice subliminal illuminati allseeing eye in the pyramid going on there very similar to kubrick s clockwork orange poster 
the mustached man holding the camera in the poster is that  happy gilmore s former boss    http  thecountcomwpcontentuploadsrichardkielhappygilmore900x487jpg 
the book is fucking crazy  just finished reading it  it escalates so quickly and you are just thinking wtf why is this happening  i dont want to spoil anything  
as a massive jg ballard fan  i can't wait 
million dollar baby
is that some james purefoy  always love seeing that guy 
ben wheatley has made some solid films imo both a field in england  and kill list  are complete mindfucks hopefully this one will be too 

i'm going to watch this wish dolph was in better movies tho 
first trailer  already straight to dvd  lol
maybe it's a heman 
wait  what 
i'm a cop you idiot 
 all new movie 
he looked pretty stiff with that front kick 
why 
so its a straight to dvd its so shitty and under budgeted that they didnt even mastered a blueray for it 
noooooooo why sell out dolph    at least make a remake of rocky 4 with just your character in it or something don't try to suck off arnold 
i need a drink that s terrible i just want to forget it  
oof just oof 
i am in 
yay 
i i i just uh 
nope  pretty sure arnold is available again now that he's not governor not interested 
hollywood is officially out of ideas 

i need help  reddit  my husband died on thursday and we buried his ashes yesterday the house is too quiet and i need something that can keep my focus what movies would you suggest to keep me company 
you should watch something he loved  or rewatch something you both enjoyed together 
thank you all such quick responses  i'd like to respond to you all individually but kniw that i really appreciate all the suggestions and will try them all i'll respond back to each after i watch each movie conversation is also a good distraction 
about time i've often thought that should something happen to my wife it's the movie i'd come back to 
try the secret life of walter mitty 
sorry for your loss  i second about time and the tree of life  if you have netflix  i think bingewatching the office might help it's comedy and a very touching story 
i watched marley amp  me a week after my best friend died and bawled like a baby 
the fountain
i'm watching this one now going to make a cup of tea and grab some ice cream 
the first movie i watched when my dad died was sundays and cybele it floored me no it's far from a feel good movie but it paints an incredible picture of relationships and how utterly devoted you can be to someone 
oddly enough    jeffrey   http  wwwimdbcomtitlett0113464    as a woman  i found it provided a nice perspective on death and grieving  while being far enough from my personal reality not to be terribly painful other than that  it's just a genial little romcom with a good cast 
my condolences to you i can't imagine what you're going through right now   the doctor   1991  is a film that explores mortality and grief william hurt is a doctor who suddenly finds himself a patient  after being diagnosed with cancer i always find it cathartic to watch 
i ve never been in your shoes  so this is either the worst or the best idea i just watched the movie truly madly deeply  1992  and stars juliet stevenson and alan rickman and directed by anthony minghella  the english patient  talented mr ripley  cold mountain   it's about a woman whose husband passed away suddenly and is dealing with the grieving aftermath he comes back as a ghost and it's about their relationship the supernatural stuff is kept to a minimum  it feels more like a play  and it's absolutely beautiful  here s the scene   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  az52td1gmt0  that convinced me to watch it  rickman only appears as a ghost through the whole movie   it's hard to find a copy but worth tracking down if you have trouble finding a copy and are interested  please pm me  and i would love to help you out with this i truly hope you find the consolation you're looking for 
cast away is the perfect movie for reflection and inspiration  things will happen  and you will feel low but you have to keep moving on this will be a movie you will return to every once in a blue moon 
sorry for your loss and i would have to say 5050 hope it helps 
if you'd like some laughs  second hand lions is a great comedy with robert duvall and michael caine not goofy stupid humor  but very funny and  warm  without being sacharine sweet 
hedwig and the angry inch  if you want something that s funny  sad and sweet 
the wrestler  blue valentine and the hunt check them out 

this poster raises so many questions  what the hell is this movie 
my friend is an extra in this  he gets beat up by jeremy irons 
up in the air
alot of movies get better with repeat viewings horrible bosses and its sequel are not those movies 
the second half of 500 days of summer 
did you know that steve buscemi played leo dicaprio dressed as a fireman and cut his hand during 911 but continued to act anyway 
clerks kevin smith can speak directly to a  single  man s heart 
i once met dolph at stockholm airport shook his hand the guy s huge 
i bet dolph ludgren spends some time teaching these kids  but then goes back to the lab for some full penetration with his hot young lab technician he teaches the kids  then some more penetration kidspenetration  kids  full penetration  and this will go back and forth for about 90 minutes until the movie just sort of ends 
i would have been super excited for this if it had come out in 1995ish     i'll    still    see    it
forrest gump fuck jenny 
i really would of liked the idea at the end of the movie more emotions pop up showing how riely is growing up and becoming more complex 
oh  dolph  vad har du gjort  
i heard dolph s only doing this movie to fund his passion project movie about a super ripped  super smart scientist who can smell crime before it happens
all i heard was trey parker 
straight to vodyikes
http  imgurcomtnqrx6v
 starring dolph lundgren asdolph lundgren 
https  youtubes5t8wsqafm
didn't realise dolph looked so good 
this is going to sound clich  d  but    the shawshank redemption    i remember seeing a post at one point  asking why that movie has such universal appeal and the top response was  basically  because every person has been andy dufresne at one point  felt trapped by circumstances beyond their control  with all hope lost  treated unfairly by the world it might help you with moving on  other ones that might help  whether they deal with this sort of thing or are just generally happy movies    city lights      about time      three colours  blue      awakenings      the grand budapest hotel      cloud atlas      spirited away      big fish    regardless  i'm sorry for your loss if you need anyone to just talk to  please pm at a moment s notice 

 ladies and gentlemen  welcome to episode viii  i'm so excited and i would give anything to be in the next one 
this and a daredevil trailer          can my day get any better 
can they make the wait even more painful   goddamn it i want episode viii now 


 the time machine   2002  when alex is standing at the store and emma is across the street in the background and the horse and carriage just plows right over her  almost everyone in the theater started laughing 
when leo was pulling himself out of the grave in the revenant couldn't help but seeing that scene in wolf of wall street where he was on quaaludes and lost it in the theatre
there s a scene in schindler s list where a jewish guy is hiding in a piano  and a nazi shoots the piano with an automatic weapon  causing it to play i burst out laughing like an idiot in front of my 12grade history class  i don't find the holocaust funny  just the fact that the piano made notes  i dunno 
it s either the milkshake moment in there will be blood or patrick swayze s snot bubble in red dawn for me 
kylo ren reveal his head was so silly looking with that hair that i just burst out laughing 
most recently  i laughed during the moment in  the revenent    s  when leo rode the horse off the cliff  
the patriot  the tomahawk scene 
kingsman church fight that moment when you see harry throwing a guy on a pillar from his pov 
high glass removing the entrails of the horse my friend next to me whispered in a desperate voice  i'm gon na fix you   
the sex scene in anomalisa hilariously awkward like if the sex scene in team america was meant to be intimate and serious 
when the japanese guy finally says  godzilla  in godzilla from 2014  it's supposed to be an ominous moment  but everyone in the theater started cracking up somethings just shouldn't be treated too seriously
the sex scene in munich
the wicker man remake with nicholas cage pretty much the whole movie i paid to see that heh 

the funniest part was when it said  allnew movie 
cancer  the movie
intouchables
i would suggest art films directed by pedro almodovar it might provide you some new insights https  enmwikipediaorgwikipedro_almod  var
awesome  just what da people needed 
this is sad because just the other day i was thinking he should play cable in deadpool 2 now  my dreams have been ripped apart  buried  dug up and shat upon 
i d suggest midnight in paris and the darjeeling limited sorry for your loss  edit  spelling
how fucking bad was my fever last night  this link is purple and upvoted  
this is going to be awful  but i'll watch it anyways 
all the episodes of the new show superstore has my wife and i in tears from laughing 
older movie   being there   starring peter sellers 
not sure why exactly  but i feel like end of the tour is good for that sort of thing  very pleasant   hanging out with people you miss  kind of vibe to it 
love it  thanks 
for the first four seconds  i was convinced that was zach galifianakis now all i want is a star wars trilogy with him as luke skywalker 
i feel as if i've barely had time to get over the hype train that was vii  but i'm so fired up and ready for round 8 
i still haven't come down from my episode vii high what are you doing to me disney
laura dern is an amazing actress glad to see her joining star wars 
mark hamillluke looks like kurt russell a little bit here  no  also  so excited  
wait  didn't they film all the scenes in that island already during ep 7 production  pretty sure i've read that they did  i guess the clip would still make sense though since officially it would still be ep 8 production even if it was many months ago 
luke looks lost in that forest of grief  despair and anger could make for an interesting character assuming they plan to bring him into the main story line and aren't just going to leave him on the island as a yoda type figure 
press announcement confirms gt  new cast members will include academy award winner benicio del toro  academy award nominee laura dern  and talented newcomer kelly marie tran  http  wwwstarwarscomnewsstarwarsepisodeviiinowfilming  cmp  smc  368071963amp  linkid  21276843
the character portrayals were nuanced and beautiful but maybe that s because thier motivations were so thin searching for what thoughts dominate the minds of the two carol  and therefore the stories conflict  suffered from the loss of her child tragic  but you witness this through a haze the film drags  the characters goggle at each other then they perform an incredible oscar worthy  luck lustre sex scene the end what  you wanted more from these characters  they're flawed you fool  this is all they can give saturated  bleak  snow the taste of disaster between each others legs carol needs to move move out  move away yet she escapes through the youth  while the youth search for experiences in their elders fuck them both  they found nothing  rooney and cate 35 experience 25 after thoughts 1
this film doesn't get enough love on here 
when javert  commits suicide   https  youtubehrzvdqh8d2q  t  2m53s  in les mis  my friend and i spent easily the next 10 minutes laughing at the sound of his back breaking unfortunately  this was at a theater and a couple people around us decided they'd rather leave than listen to us trying our best to stop snickering i still don't understand why the director would include such an immersion breaking sound in a movie almost entirely dependent on the sound mix for its success if it was at least somewhat hushed in comparison to the  massive fucking waterfall  he falls into  i'd understand 
for some reason i once watched this horrible movie called the air i breathe  which stars forest whitaker  brendan fraser and sarah michelle gellar the film is similar to 2004 s crash in that it think it's delivering a profound message by wallowing in human misery  anyway  there s one scene where we see a flashback to gellar s childhood when she first got on the school bus and her dad tried to cheer her up by doing a silly dance and then he gets hit and killed by a car what makes it especially absurd is that this is at least the second that someone in this movie gets hit by a moving car for dramatic effect i remember when i watched this movie with my family  everyone burst out laughing  you can see it  here   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  tmyrwxhff4camp  t  6m12s 
vitamin b a lot of the time
my personal plot hope is that luke has become  even more  incredibly powerful with the force  but has become sooo disillusioned by conflict that he refuses to get involved only time will tell if he finally reemerges to blow some shit up real good 
 what   noo   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  9rq7zevuwi  the entire movie was an unintentional dark comedy 
greg kinnear in  the last song  when he tells miley cyrus he has cancer couldn't control myself girlfriend was pissed  what a steamng pile of shit 
the grey with liam neeson touches on loss in a nice way i'd recommend it 
not like this 
zoe saldana has been in three blockbuster franchises set in outer space  avatar  star trek  and guardians of the galaxy perhaps to avoid confusion  she was a different colour in each one  blue  regular  green 
toy story 2 
the film doesn't have to be very complicated but it should be a very original plot and also be good don't spoiler but give the plot details  ex  looper  speed  groundhog day  momento

 interview he did with the ny times   http  wwwnytimescom20160214magazinepeeweesbigcomebackhtml  _r  1 
tell em large marge sent ya
  please have lawrence fishburne    http  youtubew3vddihjkbq  edit  nope but it also doesn't have  large marge   http  youtube8pdlxd_rro   for which 12 yr old me is immensely grateful  shivers 
wow  this actually looks really good
i feel like i have seen the whole movie
that trailer has satisfied my curiosity about this movie no need to see it now 
oh fuck 
so stupid it's awesome 

that s a great thought never saw that parallel it's a fantastic movie and is one of colin farrell s better performances

i love the voices honestly  i think it's a good primer for seeing deadpool  it shows how offthewall ryan reynolds  acting can be it's a really macabre movie that really makes you feel for the main character  jerry isn't intrinsically bad  he's just ill  and he wants so badly to connect with people  but he doesn't know how i hope this movie gets more popular since reynolds is getting a lot of attention now 
richard ayoade s  the double  comes to mind not necessarily a mindfuck kind of movie  just interestingly directed and and the plot is creative  it's about a shy man named simon james  played by jesse eisenberg in one of his best roles  imo  who works in an office and he's in love with the girl who works a few floors up  who also happens to live in the apartment across from his a man who looks exactly like him named james simon  also played by eisenberg  comes to work at his office and people instantly like his double better  because he's confident and smooth  but no one seems to notice that they look exactly alike  a couple other interesting ones that kind of fall into the same category are stranger than fiction and ruby sparks stranger than fiction is about a man who realizes that he has been the main character in someone else s novel his entire life  and sets out to find his author ruby sparks is about a novelist who writes himself  the perfect girlfriend  and she comes to life  and he has to deal with the repercussions of it 
he had a long life with many many many many many many rolls rip

i enjoy going into the forums after watching an episode of my favourite tv series  but sometimes im not up to date so i can't do it cause i hate spoilersit would be very easy for them to implement a date filter  or maybe an episode one   so as to be able to go into the forums safelywhat do you guys think  lets make it happen   sorry if it has been suggested before  i at least havent seen it 
saw this on netflix and really didn't enjoy it thought the theme of propaganda was shoehorned in since the footage they took of north korea wasn't very eventful  also  very ironically  the documentarian seems to swallow the propaganda thrown at him too easily  without much question found the final message pretty disturbing since he seems to come away thinking north korea isn't that bad  when we all know for a fact that they've committed countless human rights violations

how rooney mara wasn't nominated alongside cate blanchett in the best actress category when she had six more minutes of screen time is beyond me really  academy  does jennifer lawrence need another oscar nomination  but i digress  this movie was stunning  both visually and emotionally  as  ultimately  it's a love story a doomed one  but a love story nonetheless the two protagonists  carol and therese  are so likable when they're separate  but they have palpable chemistry when they're together  which is what a lot of romance movies forget to do nowadays  the two lovers need to be sympathetic on their own if we ever expect to like them when they're together but  through scenes of carol interacting with her young daughter  and therese s interactions with her coworkers and friends  we see that these are interesting characters that an audience can get behind and more importantly  we see that they are both stuck in a situation that they don't want to be in  a large portion of why this movie is so good has to do with its actors as i mentioned earlier  blanchett and mara are basically pitch perfect as the two lovers in this film they  along with director todd haynes  really know how to capture both the romance and the tragedy that comes along with being lesbians in that moment in history every time they share a scene together  their chemistry is damn near tangible you can tell that they felt very comfortable around one another and supporting roles from kyle chandler and sarah paulson certainly helped propel the characters  relationships forward even further  a lot of people were upset that this wasn't nominated for best picture and best director and yeah  i get it now this is a near perfect romance movie  gay or straight  and everyone should see it as soon as possible 
peewee s looking all bela lugosi these days

so are we supposed to just forget that pee wee s big adventure happened or is this supposed to be a prequel  of course he's been outside that town  he's been to the alamo and had a movie made about his life this is literally unwatchable  and by literally i mean figuratively

the similar roles of tom hardy and eric bana some of the similarities are the sort of things you'd find on a lot of actors cvs  they were both in black hawk down  they both played heroes of greek myth  members of the british nobility  70s intelligence operatives etc even the fact they've both played incredibly musclebound comic book characters isn't too much of a stretch with all the superhero movies around now  but a couple of the coincidences are definitely oddly specific  for example they've both played bald star trek villains from the romulan empire who plotted to destroy earth with super weapons  shinzon and nero  and they've both played notorious prison hard men with distinctive facial hair in biopics named for the characters alias  bronson and chopper   one final coincidence is that bana was inspired to get into acting after watching mad max  his first car was the same model as max s pursuit special and he even made a documentary about his love for it but of course when they came to recast max  rather than the australian bana  they went with hardy 
i am excited for the movie itself but i am extremely disappointed they did not get danny elfman to compose the soundtrack something just seems off about the music and it sounds extremely generic in comparison to elfman s compositions perhaps others won't care or won't even notice but it really stuck out to me for some reason   breakfast machine  danny elfman   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  gycdlw7n53a   clown dream  danny elfman   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  mlr0borsltu   stolen bike  danny elfman   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  jrg_hmzmli  there is just something about elfman s style that works so well with peewee 
looks quite a bit better than big top peewee i guess there is no story continuity between this and peewee s big adventure

i hate to just call it  the racing movie with chris hemsworth  but i don't know how else to describe it in just a few words it was a very good movie but for some reason it got little widespread attention the movie did less than 100m at the box office and got zero academy award nominations i kinda feel sorry for ron howard and all the other people that were involved with it because i think it deserved so much more recognition than what it got  i think the film was pretty excellent in all categories for those that don't know  it's based on a true story and follows the rivalry between formula 1 racers niki lauda and james hunt chris hemsworth played james hunt  who was basically the womanizing daredevil driver  whereas niki lauda was the more cold and calculating type  who looked at everything mathematically and only took risks when needed  lauda was played by daniel bruhl  you know him as the sniper in inglourious basterds  and i truly think  without hyperbole  that he is just as good of an actor as christoph waltz or michael fassbender his career isn't as good but his performance as lauda was oscar worthy  and i think he deserved it more than matthew mcconaughey s performance in dallas buyers club matt did well don't get me wrong  but bruhl really became lauda i remember watching a special feature on the bluray where he said he would be on the phone with the real niki lauda before filming  just asking about all the little details to make it as real as possible and i believe someone even said they played the voiceover narration for a formula 1 fan  and they were unable to tell the difference between him and the real guy  but honestly   the whole cast was perfect   http  wtf1coukwpcontentuploads2013098m7vtxe1024x778jpg   it's actually amazing how they were able to get actors that looked so similar without in any way hurting the quality of the performances because they all knocked it out of the park  it was also extremely well written and directed the screenplay made all the characters three dimensional and established complex relationships between them lauda was very cold and a bit of an asshole but still very good at his job and a decent guy underneath hunt was a self destructive playboy but still likable and had a genuine passion and desire to win in fact  one of my favorite bits of characterization in probably any movie is when chris hemsworth joins the mile high club and stares at himself in the mirror while he's banging the chick it really got you inside his head without saying a word hunt and lauda were rivals but there was still a certain level of respect between them  peter morgan is a great screenwriter and may be my favorite currently working he had previously worked with ron on frostnixon i think it's interesting that both of their collaborations involved the relationships between two men opposing each other  i think that s one reason i liked the movie so much there was no protagonist there was not an antagonist either they were just people and for that reason i rate it higher than a lot of biopics because so many of them shoehorn in bad guys when real life doesn't normally have clear cut bad guys this level of ambiguity made  rush  feel so much more real i believe howard said he wanted the film to feel like a race where you cheer each guy on at different times  whether or not they're on the track  but as far as the directing  howard made the race track really come alive everything felt so raw and intense and it still felt this way off the track  there s a very raw scene in a hospital which i won't spoil  but it's hard to watch   but i think the best part of the whole movie  and what made it one of the best experiences i've ever had in a theater  was the sound if it deserved an oscar for anything it was the sound watching the movie on bluray is still enjoyable  and makes you feel like you're watching a race track but when i saw it in theaters  i felt like i was actually on the race track i'm so  so glad i was one of the  apparently few  people to see it in theaters because it was an experience that home theaters can't match  but i still highly recommend it it really felt like a classic scorsese film the characterization of hunt was similar to marty s usual protagonists and it felt as raw as raging bull i really want scorsese and peter morgan to team up because i think the two would work together well since in some ways he reminds me of paul schrader  i really can't recommend  rush  more i definitely think it deserved best picture and it really felt like a modern classic when i saw it i hope it gets more attention over time because it was pretty much everything i could ever want in a movie 
daniel bruhl should ve at least been nominated the movie was my  3 that year and i was very surprised that it wasn't nominated for picture  ron howard s best in a few years imo 
great film watch senna if you get the chance 
great movie  i was a big fan of lauda when i was a kid racing go karts his recovery and return to f1 after the wreck was the stuff of legends  as was the rivalry between him and hunt great film that humanized  a couple of largerthanlife heros from my youth 
the movie is great and bruhl nailed lauda s personality  in my opinion one reason i love the movie is that for the most part it did open wheel racing justice  something some trash like driven definitely didn't however  i think because it was about open wheel racing a lot of americans snubbed it unfortunately  ricky bobby and talladega nights is what american audiences will watch in terms of auto racing that  or fast amp  furious 14 
 finally  i mention rush whenever i can on here yet i always get down voted  well  fuck you  down voters  rush is one of my favorite movies of all time i agree with you on every point you have made  good sir 
 you forgot just one thing   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qppp3eppae 
definitely the sound was the aspect of this film that stood out most for me  it really used the 1 in 51 to fantastic effect all the gear shifts and engine noise were subtlety underscored by the sub rather than constant sub boosting it was actually thoughtfully added occasionally for punctuation  a think aside from the sound editing and mix the cinematography was the star of that film it had such a vibrant and evocative use of colour and light 
the reason it wasn't successful is a general apathy towards racing 
i'm just as guilty  i didn't see it until a friend recommended it on hbo then i saw it and called my dad and demanded he watch it immediately he used to go to races like in the movie back in the day and saw james hunt and niki lauda race in person he went to a race and afterwards saw james hunt drinking beer around a campfire with fans he was just a cool guy like that 
i'm not even a huge racing fan and i thought it was amazing definitely on my top ten of all time i've seen it maybe 5 times total and i will definitely see it again 
the thing isyou lost me at  racing movie  but reading your comment you brought me back i'll check it out soon   remindme 1 week rush starring chris hemsworth
they play it on tv here in new zealand every few months and i always make sure to watch it it's a fantastic film  i've never understood the poor reviews 
was a very enjoyable film  it harkened back to those classic racing movies of the late1960 s  le mans  and grand prix 
nothing beats only god forgives in 2013  as a matter of fact ever  but this film is excellent it gave me that new found apprecation for f1 
i thought it was ok  but i saw it right after i saw  senna   a documentary about ayrton senna  the greatest f1 driver to ever do it rush s punchedup hollywood drama felt kind of pathetic and really fell flat for me after the thrilling cinema verite of senna 
i went to see it with my friends for my birthday and it genuinely surprised me with how good it was i wasn't into movies that much back then so the only thing i knew about it was chris hemsworth was in it amp  ron howard was promoting it on top gear but it was awesome probably the best sport movie of the decade i'm excited to see daniel br  hl in civil war 
i   love   this film some of the best direction ron howard has done in years  two perfectly cast performances  and some of the most stunning cinematography i've ever seen a fascinating story about rivalry  obsession  celebrity  and people pushing themselves to their limits shame it didn't get much attention stateside 
if you enjoyed this gem  you might enjoy  moon  as well 
rrushmovie
unfortunately  it was a movie about the american driverhad it been about lauda  it would have done better oh  but dashing handsome race car driver with one good year makes for better storytelling thana guy with more guts  brains  brawn and skills than f1 will ever care to see againexcept for the fact that he got horribly disfigured and would carry those scars for the rest of his life 
i love that movie
ren amp  stimpy
all the movies your ex didn't like or wouldn't want to watch with you 
 removed 
the racing scene where lauda goes airborne gave me a panic attack i was so moved by that scene because i felt the tension and concentration i recommended the movie to everyone i know and also my psychiatrist for this reason just an incredibly directed and filmed moment 
i thought it was okay the f1 sequences  particularly nurburgring were done very well the film itself felt so conventional  yes it is a real life tale that was almost tailormade as a movie story with all the againsttheodds recoveries on and off the track  but for a lot of it it fell into the same problem that so many real life stories seem to of this event happened  then this event happened   and it felt kinda safe and contrived 710 at best really  i'm amazed it's still hanging onto a place in the imdb top 250
because it sucked donkey balls
according to george clooney and channing tatum  the coens were constantly giggling throughout the production and clooney does an impersonation of their distinctive honkish laugh here s the interview https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  fivjnqerc1g and at 1  35  clooney impersonates them
incredible movie one of my all time faves
 don't go to men who are willing to kill themselves driving in circles looking for normality  as a carmotorcyle enthusiast i love this film
just nothing with a dog that dies at the end 

considering how fast the jokesinside jokespopculture references flowed past  i see this movie getting a lot of repeat viewers as well  i loved the very end  post credits scene and how the older folks laughed their asses off while many of the younger ones didn't get the reference at all 
saw deadpool on saturday got ta say ryan reynolds just absolutely killed it  he was phenomenal feel kinda happy for him since he tried  for 11 years  to get marvel to make this movie oh  and morena baccarin is smoking hot 

phenomenal film  got me interested in the sport and i've been a fan since easily one of my favorite movies of all time i'm no movie critic or anything but i thought it definitely should ve been nominated for something 
that s the movie that made me fall in man  crush love with daniel bruhl  ps if you want to see more of daniel bruhl  watch goodbye lenin 
f1 racing doesn't excite an american crowd  and the time frame was too dated i am of the age to remember it all  and the years when the ford gt 40 s attacked the racing circuit in their divisions such isn't going to stir an audience anymore 
ah yes  it's that time of year when every person talks about how their mediocretopretty good favorite film of the last few years got snubbed by the academy 
it was really  really mediocre the one thing i'll give it is how accurately recreated the crashes were 
 90 million against a  40 million budget is considered  not too well  on rmovies 
i loved this movie 
movies that will make you laugh  and favourites from when i was a kids have always been my goto after a breakup 
it was one of my favourite movies of that year and words can not describe how disappointed i am that so many people have no idea what it is  everyone in the movie was fantastic but daniel bruhl was fucking phenomenal i really believe he should ve been nominated that year i was on constantly on edge the  entire  duration of the movie and those racing scenes were just something else 
gt  i hate to just call it  the racing movie with chris hemsworth  but i don't know how else to describe it in just a few words  call it the 1976 f1 championship  and ya  it was an amazing movie the only minor criticism i has is the one with hunt punching the reporter that never happened  and wouldn't have happened  also  nikia lauda is still an asshole today that talks a lot of shit  but everyone likes him for it 
it did fine at the box office it made  90 million off a  38 million dollar budget since formula 1 is not popular in the us it was never going to be a box office hit in the states  it is a solid movie though and more people should see it 
rush wouldn't have made my top 10 personally i thought it was a good movie  but in a thick thick year of film it just wasn't up there for me 
rush is just about something that s sadly to niche to do really well also the casting was one goddamn point  they main actors really do look exactly like who they were portraying
awesome movie as a fan of f1 for years  i found it to be more exciting than the current f1 racing i wish things would go back to rivalries like that 
i loved it  howard s direction was incredible  bruhl and hemsworth were both great in it  and the score was one of hans zimmer s best in years 
it is a niche thing i love vintage f1 related stuff  so i really enjoyed rush daniel bruhl absolutely  nailed  playing niki luada but for those who don't give a shit about auto racing  it was probably just a decent movie i still like grand prix  1966  better  though it is fictional instead of biographical the incar racing scenes and race footage were much better imo more intense racing footage may have broadened the appeal of rush  but it was still pretty good in any case i don't think that the producers or ron howard were expecting this movie to be a major hit they probably expected better  or they probably wouldn't have gone ahead with the project  but i'm glad that they did we need something for people who don't go in for costumed superheroes 
the sound in general was great  but i absolutely adored the score it's fantastic  daniel bruhl is very good in it ever since i saw him in joyeux no  l i've liked him 
so hear me out here  everyone assumes that days of future past retconned wade wilson from xmen origins and turned him into the wade wilson from deadpool the problem with this is that the past portions of dofp take place in 1973  while the scene with team x in xmen origins takes place in 1979 the wade wilson from xmen origins would have already been born sometime in the 1950 s  maybe even late 40 s   while the wade wilson from deadpool wasn't born until sometime in the 80 s  or late 70 s   my headcanon is that the original wade wilson probably abandoned deadpool  gave him up for adoption  or simply passed away while acting as a mercenary i understand that many will think that i'm taking details from  deadpool  too seriously  but i think it's fun to think about it  especially when  i love having an overview over the xmen cinematic universe   https  wwwredditcomrmoviescomments26vlqlxmen_visual_timeline_oc   tl  dr  wade wilson from deadpool is possibly the son of an alternate version of the wade wilson from xmen origins  wolverine 
xmen origins wolverine is no longer canon in the xmen series 
what is there to explain or think about  the origins version of deadpool is shit  and the new one is the apology 
honestly i knew nothing about it and assumed it was a  rush  biopic or something so just glossed over it based on your comments i will check it out 
i wrote that line on a bomb dropped during operation shock and awe 
many of the scenes in american psycho  most notably christian bale running around half naked with a chainsaw although maybe that was the point  
i'm not a fan of ron howard i like apollo 13  but everything else has been mediocre to bad i loved rush unlike a beautiful mind  he didn't shy away from the controversial aspects of their lives the performances were fantastic  and the racing scenes were really well directed 
gone girl 
   eternal sunshine of the spotless mind

i did find it weird that aside from the two primary emotions  the other three  anger  disgust  fear  were generally negative emotions  although of course with practical uses in the right context   it might ve been better to have some more positive emotions included  although i don't quite know what they could be

gt  they ll treat you like you're stupid  which is the one thing deadpool didn't do  definitely my biggest gripe with movies 
there are always some terrible trends in hollywood right now there are those ya book adaptations that are starting to become less profitable  so it's time for something new i'll just  as i often do  wait for some reviews for a movie before seeing it 
hollywood learns the wrong lessons from   everything   
just like comics learned the wrong lesson with watchmen 
i share james gunn s concerns and said this the other day you can easily imagine fox doing their next  keeptherights   fantastic four  reboot as a raunchy and meta rrated film  which makes me want to throw up you can even more easily imagine  new ips  being deadpoolized  i'd like to believe hollywood is better than that  but 
i'm going to go against popular opinion here  everyone here is shitting on  hollywood  but hollywood is a massive industry with several different production companies each overseeing many  many projects that involve many  many different people some of these studios  projects  people  etc pull off amazing successes  and some of them end up as complete duds for the most part  movie ticket sales have been increasing year after year  at a rate higher than inflation  so i would say hollywood is doing a pretty good job so when it comes to deadpool  if hollywood pumps out a bunch of r rated action comedies and runs that into the ground  but they make a shitton of money doing so  they didn't learn the wrong lessons  maybe if the general public actually supported new and creative projects  hollywood would take more risks when the top grossing movies of the past decade have overwhelmingly been remakes or sequels  that says more about the audience than the producer 
gt  like a series of increasingly inane injokes unspooling in a reddit thread  huh wonder where he could get that impression from this site  gt   i saw it happen with guardians  gt  and next thing i know i hear of a hundred film projects being set up like guardians  and i start seeing dozens of trailers exactly like the guardians trailer with a big pop song and a bunch of quips  did i miss that trend   i'm not sure what he's referencing

it makes you wonder sometimes who is behind the movie making decisions sometimes i'll see a movie be advertised where the preview shows absolutely everything in the movie  and no one was very interested to begin with then you hear it cost  150 mil to make plus  100 mil in advertising you just have to wonder whose making these decisions it's refreshing to see how well deadpool is doing  58 mil to make  amazing marketing  etc you'd think hollywood would learn from this  but you know they won't

i wish my student loan balance was  1500 
if you dont show up to court after you have been served this is what happens he has been ignoring collection attempts  he got served and ignored that too im not in favor of this man being arrested but you can't ignore court summons if you get served you have to go 
that dude could not come up with  1500 in 29 years 
maybe it was the night man 
if i didn't pay back a federal loan for 29 years  i'd kind of expect for there to be negative effects this dude didn't pay his loan  including when he was taken to court over it and received a judgment from the court specifically telling him to pay it if you ignore a court order  you're gon na have a bad time  i mean yes  the financial aid system needs to be fixed  but they're going after people who purposely aren't paying their loans which is a surprising amount of people  given how many refund chasers there are in the world for anyone else  there are programs like deferment options  sliding payscales  and whatever else along with loan forgiveness after 20 years  it's a shitty system  but this guy s case is not going to be the one to change it because he doesn't deserve to have people dying on his hill for his particular cause

gt  reached for comment on saturday  a highway patrol official said the motorcycle driver who was leading the procession was pulled over after attempting to halt traffic in the no 5 lane so that the motorcade could pass  gt  gt  although the officer initiated the traffic stop on the lead vehicle only  and indicated to other members of the procession that they could continue on  some of them chose to pull over as well  said sgt jose nunez  a chp spokesman  gt  gt  the motorcycle driver was cited for illegal lighting  and his vehicle was impounded because his driver s license was not current  according to nunez    gt   it exceeds the bounds of all human decency   said family attorney edward ramsey  an officer has the discretion to stop or not stop a funeral procession if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  he didn't stop the funeral procession  all he did was stop the unlicensed driver that was breaking the law

the entitlement attitude of so many americans  gt  if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  your funeral escort was driving without a valid license the chp was correct to pull him over and cite him the rest of the funeral procession was free to continue on but you chose to pull over instead that was your own decision that caused you to be late the funeral  what is so aggravating to me about this is the family will file a lawsuit and probably win they will get to think they are right but they will milk the taxpayers of thousands of dollars 
what s bizarre is this concept of  respect  for the dead by parading the corpse around  or what s left of it after it's been embalmed that shit is just fucking weird burn it and get on with it don't fuck up an interstate just because of your idiotic traditions 

man  why do the people who run this state have to be such major assholes 
pfft  what  really  happened was that the onduty cops didn't have cable at their station so they watched it through the windows 
every interaction i have ever had with navient  they have done everything they can to work with me  is your payment affordable  would you like a deferment  etc  i have had to take them up on that because of divorce not saying that is everyone s experience but they haven't been the loan sharks everyone else seems to act like they are just one man s experience though 

i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors 
where in this article did it say  guns drawn  as most people are stating here  it says  with guns   every on duty us marshal goes through their day  with guns   someone signed a contract for a loan  and then spends almost three decades not paying it i agree that a police force shouldn't have been used there are financial measures that can be taken upon default of a loan rather than criminal  but i'm really surprised by the circle jerk that s happening over a fox news article 
gt  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  this almost reads like satire 


i'm gon na take a stab in the dark and say its just the immense social pressure in the area to be successful but thats just me

not really too much context given here  so it's hard to guess at the actual situation  but federal student loans  at least direct loans and the majority of those older loans passed back to fsa as they phased out the guarantee programs  don't get sold to private collection agencies at this time maybe that part happened a while back  before current policies went into place and the collectors are taking advantage of the protections that federallyoriginated loans have  anyway  for people who are interested in learning more about how defaulted federal student loans are being collected today   check this out   https  wwwfbogovindex  s  opportunityamp  mode  formamp  id  216a8418f8e71f0c9c3475946ab100f8amp  tab  coreamp  _cview  1  they're currently in the middle of contracting new private collection agencies to service defaulted loans and you can see in the rfp documents how agencies are being scored and how that ties into account assignments  basically  for those who don't feel like running through all of it  the big emphasis for student loan collections now is getting people through affordable rehabilitation options and into incomedriven repayment plans placements look like they're going to be based about 50  on careful regulatory compliance and borrower satisfaction surveys  which would make it extremely difficult for high pressure collections tactics to work out in the long run  none of that changes this story  just thought it was interesting in light of some of the comments i've read that indicate people believe strongarm collection tactics for student loans will always be the norm  tldr  they're at least trying to throw a friendly paint job over the horribly broken federal student loan system these days 
i'm socialist and firmly believe that education and medical care should be paid for by federal government out of contributions that we make  however with that said  if you are contributing member of society you have to be a special kind of asshole not to repay  1500 loan over the period of 29 years no matter what was that loan used for 
gt  barbins has been charged with  displaying obscene matter to a minor  and child pornography  police say  sounds like a molestation charge is soon to follow

i knew this story was light on facts turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies  source   yahoo finance   https  financeyahoocomnewspaulakerusmarshalstudentloandebtarrest212047386html 
gt  the judge who refused to dismiss the case this month has denied cosby s appeal of that decision  so is that like asking your parents if they are really really sure that you are grounded 
til that most people have no understanding how the court system works  yes  civil attorneys can issue subpoenas  yes  a court can hold you in contempt if you fail to appear yes  a potential punishment for contempt is a bench warrant for your arrest  tl  dr  you can not simply ignore subpoenas you may go to jail 
forever grateful i graduated with minimal student loans can't ignore bills for 25 years though  regardless of what those payments stem from from reading through the comments here  it seems like incomebased payment option is the smartest option 
lol  you guys are so gullible the guy dodged this debt and refused to engage the proper authorities for 25 years this isn't a new college graduate that missed one payment then you have the cascade of predictable posts stating  boot lickers    debtors prison  and how in 30 years this will be the watershed moment we all look back to as we are enslaved by the government this is a statement case the feds took an extreme example and made an extreme example of this putz the goal of this action is compliance and to get folks to not ignore their obligations the money spent on this will scare the other million folks that are past due to actually pick up the phone and engage them to resolve the debt no one held a gun to this guy s head to sign up for the student loans and no one was stopping him for 25 years from making a payment plan for the remaining  1500 this guy deserved it and as a tax payer this is ok by me 
what happens if you literally can't pay your loans  asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11  just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job  edit  something a lot of you don't seem to realize is that these were private loans there s no forgiveness with those

cox is actually a familyowned business one of the major interest holders is a 96 year old woman who inherited from her father  she had been running it with her sister until her death in 2007   i happen to think they're one of the leastshady isp and cable providers out there  they also own the travel channel  which is a pretty great channel 
umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops there s hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops 
student loans were made with certain assumptions about the future of the economy  both on the part of the schools  the tuition they charge   the lenders  and the student people should be required to pay their student loans but they should be adjusted downward  edit  this guy had a loan for  1500 measly bucks and didn't make any payments in 30 years  i would like to know if he was destitute  or just decided  fuck you everyone  i want to keep my money  

in case you're wondering which was the worst charity in america  that would be the kids wish network  as identified in 2013 on this list  http  wwwtampabaycomamericasworstcharities
so to sum that up we don't have to worry about any cox blocking 
sad that a majority of these are cancer related hopefully karma will catch up to them 
here on the west coast we're already getting serious fallout from china s fucking pollution 
well that s one bit of good news from cox now if they'd stop raising my rates every few months 
i ve been really happy with cox for an isp both personally and professionally here in okc personally  out of nowhere they bumped my at home connection from 15mbit to 100mbit and my bill  went down  30  all out of nowhere  without me saying a word internet is always up  not throttled  and they have decent support if it's needed  professionally at my job i ran in ip phone deployment with them for our main office  3 satellite offices they were there 100  of the way i have personal names and numbers to call in the event of issues outside of the scope of my support as the companies it admin  and when we've needed someone on site to climb a pole for instance their longest response time was 45 minutes  i know this sounds like rhailcorporate but the fact is out of all the isps i've had  comcast  qwest  charter  etc  they've been the best that s not saying they shouldn't and couldn't be better  but they're angels next to the others  in fact they proactively contact me at work every once and awhile to check on things which i greatly appreciate and they bring us cookies every month yes  our isp brings yes cookies no  we're not a big company 9 employees they're just nice 
i know it is a reach but why do these people need to make high salaries it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people if pay is needed then just like congress no more than 80k you are performing a service for people  10 of those charities involve the police the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets 
free expression runs counter to the new religion of progressivism the two simply are not compatible 
between cox and cable one in both places i live  i actually like our midwest internet providers i feel bad for people getting rammed by twc and comcast we've paid  45 for 100mbps for several years  which sounds way better than the horror stories i hear from you guys 
they sent me a few emails in the past  so i got a vpn i will still use it  but good on cox for not being dickbags 
the obvious solution to me is the banning or at least rerouting of all caltrains from this particular area

misleading title the marshals service will  arrest  you if you fail to show up for a court appearance you are not being tossed in jail  you are being hauled into court when you refused to answer a summons  from the article   paul aker says he was arrested at his home last week for a  1500 federal student loan he received in 1987  he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29yearold school loan  does anyone feel sorry for this man   1500  be serious 

i like that guy after all  i would just do it for the money  with minimal violence  and would never want to kill people so  if i ever decide to go and work for a cartel  i'm  definitely  working for el jesus

i hope they get it right and protest the us department of education if student loans are your issue  go straight to the source of your ills ironically enough  the only way to end student debt is to scale down and eventually eliminate the student loan program 
i believe this happened as i heard this story from other news sources  but some info had to be left out or missing in the us if you owe money on a debt the personcompany has seven years to collect if they don't the debt disappears if they take you to court and get a judgement they have ten years to collect and it can be renewed for ten more years the only way he could be arrested is if the loan company took him to court  won a judgement and then took further action to force the debtor to court this would not be something to come out of the blue 
all in all i've been pretty happy with cox as an isp i've used them in two different cities and it's always been reliable and fast i pay for 300mbps service and always get those speeds  usually higher almost no outages they're putting in 1gbs service in many of their cities right now  including mine  my biggest gripe with them is they have a soft data cap of 2 tb for my tier they do not enforce the caps at all but the fact that they exist means they are probably toying with the idea and there would be nothing to stop them from going evil since they are a monopoly like every other major isp it's like a benevolent dictatorship  http  wwwspeedtestnetmyresult5089441276 that s with a netflix stream going on in another room right now

as a customer this is the first good thing i've ever heard from cox 
isps don't actually want to spy on their customers like that it costs more money to put systems in place to do so and to maintain and operate those systems on top of that  it will only bring them bad press that could piss off customers  cox is basically saying  fuck you i'm not taking a significant financial hit to spy on our customers so you can sue them and make money for yourself  they are doing the right thing  and the right thing also happens to be in their best business interest 
they do not care what police do with them  they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them  edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create  that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all  they do not care about you you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle

on the other hand  if the business stops taking food stamps entirely  not only can they not get the kale you want to make them eat  but they also can't get a loaf of bread or gallon of milk unless they start selling their food stamps to get cash to buy the milk and bread so the business still makes their money  the amount of food stamp fraud goes up  and the poor that you claim to be helping are getting even less food  healthy or otherwise  because of the food stampcash exchange rate

i grew up in a very small rural town  the high school i attended is part of a huge high school rivalry  one of the biggest in the nation hell its not uncommon for 20000 plus fans to attend the rivalry game  its so big it's held in a college stadium and has more people attend it then the college division 1 team any way i have friends and family members who are convinced the only way to go to college and make something out of yourself is to get there on a football scholarship one of my cousins young kid 16ish has already had a few concussions  his dad just chalks it up to part of the game and thinks parents need to stop being such  pussies  football is for men and if a boy can't take it he will never be a man sadly i think a lot of parents feel this way 
good for him  football doesn't have to be a concussion prone sport it started as the american version of rugby  and evolved into the form we see today  and can just as properly evolve into something that isn't effectively a form of human sacrifice  part of how it evolved is the career of pop warner  the coach of the carlisle indian school he kept  how to put it  coaching like a lawyer  and coming up with clever ways to get an edge  that would then eb slapped down with rule changes  surely concussions justify rule changes too 
this is really just a click bait story no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers  i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is 
plot twist  he can't shoot 
smart move by him  if anything athletes should be focusing back on baseball guaranteed money and long contracts
suffered some pretty brutal concussions playing hoops in high school and college if he is looking to mitigate his risk  he might want to rethink athletics all together 
that seems like quite a comedown  with all due respect to this fine institution

i certainly appreciate what david has done here but  with all due respect to david  most americans would rather not see financial industry groups  like the carlyle group  suck economic resources out ofaway from most americans instead  we'd prefer to pay for these efforts through widespread  robust economic opportunities and the tax contributions they make possible millions of americans and this nation have been greatly diminished as a result of the business activities of groups  like the carlyle group  over several decades  because of grotesque incomewealth inequality  the odds of seeing successful businesspeople like david rubinstein are greatly diminished he only got where he was because of the social ladder that used to exist in this nation 
i wonder how many huge donations like this  maybe smaller  in the hundreds of thousands  have been made for national monuments pretty awesome someone did this wo reading the article  i have to imagine there s a good amount of rigmarole on the donor s end to ensure the donation goes to where the donor actually wanted govt accountability on any level in the us seems kind of weak lately 
let s laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on nonessential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way  edit  and get tax breaks from it too

if obesity and other nutrition related issues are such a problem among the poor  wouldn't it be more cost effective to do away with food stamps and implement something like a food box program instead  in other words would the cost of labor to package and ship prepared food boxes in bulk to grocery stores and distribution centers be offset by what would be saved in reduced healthcare costs  imagine a program where you list the people in your household  any allergies or specific requirements and a box is prepared to supplement your family for a week it could contain things like rice  beans  canned or pouched goods like meats  vegetables and fruits  dried oatmeal and cereals  powdered milk  cooking oil every month they could receive a selection of 5 spices  salt and pepper and even a recipe pamphlet if in addition to the box  they started a program where grocery stores and produce growers could drop off older or bruised produce  people could pick some up for free when they picked up their boxes

i love how this article just glosses over the fact that arellano had previous dui convictions which is why he didn't receive the same sentence  this was couch s first dui case which is why he got probation  as texas takes the rehab route  but whatever lets rage and ignore the facts
horrible headline  38 cases of dui manslaughter in texas since 2005 and only 3 of them went to adult court  that tells you the vast majority of these cases are handled with kid glovesso picking out one of 3 that went the other route and comparing it to the affluenza case is disingenuous  but fuck it  that is what the media does today god forbid they instead do an article focusing on how in texas if you are a drunk driving kid that kills people you will get away with it 35 out of 38 times

come gather around the fire and listen to a tale of a spooky and simple explanation of our increasing tuition rates in the us  the government started giving student loans kids take the debt  the schools get the money tuition prices increase because they can rely on the kids to get a gov loan take away student loans  then schools can't rely on this money  kids can't afford the jacked up tuitions  enrollments drop  schools are forced to cut tuition  now more affordable again it's the same problem with mortgage crisis  just a different industry

friend of mine called to ask why he couldnt connect  he obviously can't check if there are outages in his neighborhood without the internet  he calls them and they offer to send a tech to his house for like  80  they didnt tell him the price  but you know itd be up there  he spends an hour checking all his connections  digging through paperwork to find his modem settings page  finally calls back about 8hrs later hoping to talk to someone else and theyre like   oh yeah  there s an outage in your area   idiots 
interesting though   since 2005  texas has prosecuted 38 juveniles for intoxication manslaughter or intoxication assault only three were sent to the adult system  and half of all cases resulted in probation of some kind  i think this is more telling of the justice system  and accessibility to competent  quality counsel it's clear money buys better legal counsel  but if the government subsidized public defense more heavily  the outcomes would clearly be different

loss of internet and television access for 3 days would cause mass panic and riots
for comcast  it was tuesday 
just having comcast in general makes them angry 
there needs to be legally mandated uptime and speed requirements  95  of the time your connection must reach the  advertised  speed  no more  up to xmbps  allowed  and 99  of the time it must reach 14 of that speed if this isn't met then customers must be completely refunded for that month 
comcast is used to pissing people off they won't give a fuck 
so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming and this was the great marketing that is killing them 
you don't automatically get a dui in fact 
i'm fully expecting to get downvoted to hell here  but what the heck  i'm not particularly fond of comcast  but unless i missed something here  which is entirely possible   this doesn't actually sound like it was particularly horrific for people in general it sounds like a very small fraction of their nationwide customer base  had an outage of parts of their service for about 3 or 4 hours  not even all of their service  but things like they couldn't access their hd channels  or their internet didn't work for a few hours  i understand for businesses  an internet outage can be a big deal  so some outrage on their part would be justified  but for the general consumer  come on  get a grip go read a book for a while  or go outside for a bit  or  gasp  go do something with your family  i'm just not getting what the huge deal was here  what am i missing 
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window 
gt  across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast  in my town alone  
it didn't seem to mention how they had the same judge  we've already established this same judge would have been open to giving a similar sentence to a poor minority because she tried to do just that keep making this a race issue  though lord knows the media loves to stir up ignorant poor folks  also  anyone who comes to the us illegally and kills is citizens deserves little sympathy he was a juvenile  so it would be appropriate to release him and deport him  i don't understand the need to distort issues to make tbem about race we already have enough problems it's already an established fact that those with the means to afford a lawyer fair better than those who don't 
can someone eli5 me why we even need fracked oil right now when prices are projected to keep dropping

i certainly don't necessarily agree with public funds being used for a sports stadium  and i definitely don't agree with nepotism  but i think criticizing mike illitch somehow taking advantage of detroit is a shortsighted mistake had it not been for mr illitch pretty much singlehandily reinvesting in a city everyone wanted to leave behind over the last 20 years  the city wouldn't even be close to back on a path to relevancy  whether you want to believe it is or not   the other thing to consider is that this new complex not only brings commerce to an area that was a combination of blight and open fields  it also brings quite a few jobs to the city  as well as some stateoftheart buildings that will bring commerce and international travelers to the area for a variety of reasons  conferences  concerts  etc   this all equals more money for the city of detroit  which is why they're willing to make the investment in the first place   and another part of a blightfilled neighborhood updated and usable for the future  this is a sticky situation that reeks of an unfortunate quidproquo  but when it comes to what is good for the city of detroit  it's hard to argue that anyone has anything on the passion and dedication of mike illitch 
but  guys  come on we need our circuses  what would we do with out national sports  concentrate on real issues  lol  that s no fun  
living in germany and studying  i'm gon na pay 300   335   for the upcoming semester  these 335  also includes a public transportation ticket  which is in your student id  that allows me to take the train  bus  tram etc at any time as much as i like in my entire state  books aren't nearly as expensive as in the us  the most expensive book i bought last semester was 80   89    but  seriously  95  of the content for the majority of the courses are uploaded on the university s website  files and documents which you can download for free  also  the university canteen offers you decent food for a fair price  normally around 35   in the end my biggest expenses during my semester are the coffees i buy on campus
well  that ought to take care of the problem 
ah  a local spin on the old  congressperson becomes lobbyist  setup 
this is how it worksthere isn't anything new to this story that isn't happening in nearly every major city and state across the country  i don't like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it 
good old cronyism at its finest  nothing new to detroit at all 
same shit happened here in richardson  texas  a suburb of dallas   the mayor brought in a huge company to the city and then left office to get a job with that same company it also turns out she was having an affair with a guy from that company too

i'm from the uk and have lived in germany for 6 years now i came here with a 20000 gbp student loan for a 4 year degree in computer science  now i'm about to start a masters in web science that will cost me about 1000 eur for the 2 year course  parttime and remote  i'm also just about to get german citizenship  most germans are happy to speak english  i have a job here and although most of the company speak english they make i point of speaking german with me  and i with them  i'm not very good at german but am slowly learning now after 5 years of being very lazy about learning the language it's a very hard language to learn  screw those articles   but in time you ll get used to it  i absolutely love speaking to locals in german and being understood by them  to me it's like being on another planet and finally being accepted by the local populus  good luck to anyone who wants to come over  it is a wise move  come and see me near koblenz 
many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like you have to be way more self organised and please don't expect multiple choice tests 
clickbait no one around here is remotely upset about taxpayer funds going to a new stadium for the most popular team in town we're not really unhappy about the new development for business and residences that is happening and we're not raising any concerns about the effort to revitalize the city  detroit is climbing out of a hole created by the corruption of influential individuals local business and leaders have been more beneficial in this process than any other group and this stadium  and the district surrounding it are seen as victories in this effort 
the fee is actually 150500  per semester books inclusive because of librarys and because we live in 2016 and share digitaly public transport also free  you get 600  per month plus health care  if your parents arent rich  this will be checked by government  as student  and will have to pay back   half of that   in worst conditions after you finished  also  after 3 semesters you must have passed 23 of your finals at any time to get your  baf  g  money  but this will only be checked once no money for extra semesters of course

colleges really need to stop expelling students due to these kangaroo courts  i'm fine with them if it's from breaking a school infraction like alcohol on a dry campus or something of that sort but  if a student is accused of a criminal offense  let the courts deal with it and decide from there  schools aren't equipped to deal with these kinds of cases  nor should they be expected to be these are lifechanging accusations and need to be treated as such  for the benefit of both parties involved 
who s the idiot who decided that kangaroo courts were a good idea

i would like to remind everyone that bernie sanders has aligned himself with and defended the black lives matter movement in many of his speeches he talks about sandra bland  michael brown  eric garner and in typical fashion blames racism and the white establishment sanders never once mentions the blacks that are home invading in indianapolis  kansas city  atlanta  etc he never once talks about the blacks that have shot at and killed police  most recently a 19 year old black man shoots an officer in mississippi black lives matter and politicians like sanders are waging that the future will be less white and in that future you folks can imagine who will be the most vile and racist  edit  from today  white house tweets shoutout to grammy winner of best rap album  still no word on recent spate of cop killings

at that rate the entire female population of the us would be married off in 11 years certainly 37000 child marriages a day is unsustainable or maybe it's media hype

these statistics seem unreliable estimated 12 billion new child marriages by 2050  even taking the 37000 a day estimate at face value that would only get you to 500 million by 2050  i mean seriously  assuming population growth rates remain unchanged  unlikely as the rate is slowing significantly  there will only be  47 billion women born under the age of 8 by 2050 is it truly believable that a quarter of women born in the next 34 years are going to be placed into a child marriage

this is the dark side of welfare  the constitution is completely circumvented the government has the power to cajole and pressure when it is putting stipulations on the money it gave out the government is capable of doing things it would never have the power of doing otherwise  like forcing a business to carry certain products  or forcing a person to apply for jobs or eventually  forcing people to work at government labor jobs

i understand what you are trying to do with your anecdotal case comparisons however  they aren't comparable cases when you consider all the factors  including criminal history  but  even if you ignore all the other factors  i know of a white 20 yo male from a fairly wealthy family in my area who was sent to prison for a year based on a drunk driving accident so my anecdotal evidence shows similar punishment to your anecdotal case thereby anecdotally refuting your point

i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them 
they haven't decided at what point of gestation this would happen  gt  montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring fetal anesthesia before surgeries  including abortion  after 20 or more gestational weeks  so  4 months the general consensus for viability outside the womb is around 6 monthsish for some the concept of consciousness coincides with viability outside the womb 
isn't this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor s office  would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder 
i'm going to talk about this as delicately as possible i  genuinely  want thoughts and opinions on this subject  i am asking that no one become immediately offended by what i'm about to say rather than respond with your opinion telling me why you believe that my view should change i am childfree i don't want kids  i'm 35  so it's pretty much set in stone at this juncture in my life i don't see myself as a prolife or prochoice supporter and the reason for that is because i kind of agree with both sides on one hand i firmly believe that the destruction of a human being  born or not  is murder it fits the definition  of  murder before you downvote me into oblivion  let me be clear it's not the votes i care about it's that you understand where i'm coming from even though i have that belief  i also believe that some people were just not meant to be children but therein lies another debate  why don't they place it in adoption  because most of the time unwanted children are kept  they're not placed into adoption and when they're kept their chances of being neglected as children  whether it be mentally  emotionally  or physically  rise exponentially i certainly wouldn't want to have a child and resent it i  don't  have children because frankly i'm mean as a damn snake i don't see any part of me that could ever have a child and not lose my temper with it and i wouldn't put a kid through that  because  i  was put through that i would be a horrible parent  anyway  i have a point i swear if you're going to have an abortion  why anesthetize it first  do i believe that it can feel  absolutely  but you're killing it i mean it's not like you're putting it to sleep and saying   here  fight for your life  you're fucking killing it so why have a crisis of conscience about it  again  i'm sorry if i offend anyone  that s not my intention i'm just a realistic person and it is what it is sugarcoating it doesn't change it the bill seems like a waste of time and tax dollars  edit  i don't understand why this is being downvoted so  please  give me your views instead of leaving me wondering because if there s something i'm not understanding it needs to be made clear again this is absolutely not about the votes rather than having a discussion 
if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pain
because that makes it okay  smh 
this is standard practice in the us judicial system outcomes will vary from case to case depending on financial status there s actually a legal term for it  it's called   cream  
wether a fetus is under anesthesia is completely dependent on the type of anesthetic being performed any general anesthetic also anesthetizes the fetus while other types like spinal or local do not even then  there is no accurate way to quantify or measure awareness in fetuses  much less adults undergoing anesthesia the body also still responds to pain under anesthesia  as its an autonomic response  so the definition of  feeling pain  is not something that should be measured i feel like awareness  which is impossible to measure in a fetus regardless  is a real idicator of humanity an easy solution would be to simply do all elective abortions under general anesthesia  which may cost more  but is easily doable i have no idea what the preferred method of anesthesia is  if any  for elective abortions  source  i do anesthesia in a catholic hospital 
i said this somwhere else  but it's also pertinent here  everyone is equal under the law and money is how we measure that equality 
i mean  we already use anesthesia on fetuses when performing surgery in the womb for exactly this reason  so it's hardly surprising  http  wwwdoctorsonfetalpaincomfetalpaintheevidence5documentation

where is the groundswell of the righteously indignant right wing militia that was supposed to come to his aid 
 daughterinlaw briana bundy said tuesday that a federal judge in oregon should let the 69yearold live at home while he awaits trial  sure that s an excellent suggestion i would further suggest that the judge prepare a lunch of peanut butter sandwiches with home made raspberry jam and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies for mr bundy each day 
hope he gets the  negros  there to hear his theory or their culture and living style 
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time 

from  government  s memorandum in support of its motion for pretrial detention   http  wwwscribdcomdoc29947153421616doc4usavclivenbundyusadetentionmemorandumforclivenbundy  gt  bundy is lawless and violent he does not recognize federal courts  claiming they are illegitimate  does not recognize federal law  refuses to obey federal court orders  has already used force and violence against federal law enforcement officers while they were enforcing federal court orders  nearly causing catastrophic loss of life or injury to others he has pledged to do so again in the future to keep federal law enforcement officers from enforcing the law against him as of the date of this hearing  he continues to violate federal court orders and continues to possess the proceeds of his illegal activities  gt  gt  bundy is currently charged with crimes of violence including using and brandishing firearms in connection with crimes of violence under title 18  united states code  section 924  c   as such  the bail reform act presumes that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that will ensure the safety of the community 18 usc  3142  e   3   b   here  no evidence has been adduced during the investigation of the instant charges that even remotely hints at a rebuttal to that presumption in fact  all the evidence suggests that bundy will continue to act lawlessly  will not abide by court orders  and will use violence to ensure that federal laws are not enforced as to him 
well then that s that 
gt  the judge said bundy  69  is a flight risk and a danger to the community in the bail hearing tuesday afternoon in downtown portland i mean i can't really find a reason not to agree with that a 69 year old who doesn't believe he's beholden to the law is as dangerous as a 29 year old who doesn't believe he's beholden to the law 
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time 
gee  it's almost like different judges and prosecutors in different areas with separate cases can lead to different verdicts or something 
there s actually a legal question that you asked 
if someone is brought up too rich to not know the difference between right and wrong  why can the same argument not be used for poor people who commit crimes  people who are brought up in poverty don't really know right from wrong just as much as a kid who has rich parents 
law is adversarial lawyers are tasked with presenting their subjective truth and having a judgejury believe their arguments if law ever becomes like a science that seeks the objective truth  stuff like this will stop happening 
we need to stop this immigration because when america sends its people  it sends unskilled people and we have to spend our money on them we are going to build a wall  get america to pay for it and make germany great again 
the difference  money 
biggest problem in the universe  vote it up  http  thebiggestproblemintheuniversecomepisode89
that s what  affluenza  means literally the entire point of this case and why it's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich 
obviously as white god intended 
to be fair  he was working with him then too 
if you're a bernie supporter  who thinks a public funded  1 trillion dollar infrastructure package is a good deal because jobs  but is outraged by the state of michigan investing  285 million in the renovationrevitalization of its  largest city  then you might want to reexamine one of those positions

tl  dr  apple has to provide the means to extract encrypted data from the device fbi will then try to decrypt it  i assume by brute force  would would be easy for a 4digit pin   the interesting part is that the device is owned by farook s employer  the san bernardino county department of public health had they been following proper device protocol  they would already have administrator access to it  this was literally government property used for terrorism  and now unsearchable not due to the  encryption  boogeyman but their own ineptitude 
gt  the judge ruled tuesday that the cupertinobased company had to provide  reasonable technical assistance  to the government in recovering data from the iphone 5c  including bypassing the autoerase function and allowing investigators to submit an unlimited number of passwords in their attempts to unlock the phone apple has five days to respond to the court if it believes that compliance would be  unreasonably burdensome  so it sounds like the government doesn't think apple can bypass it for them  just make it easier for them to brute force i bet judge s ruling will hold up  too 
so more than two months later and they are still farting around getting information that could be important in preventing future actions  wtf 

so an illegal escort vehicle gets pulled over and the entire funeral pulls over to raise hell 
gt  reached for comment on saturday  a highway patrol official said the motorcycle driver who was leading the procession was pulled over after attempting to halt traffic in the no 5 lane so that the motorcade could pass  gt  gt  although the officer initiated the traffic stop on the lead vehicle only  and indicated to other members of the procession that they could continue on  some of them chose to pull over as well  said sgt jose nunez  a chp spokesman  gt  gt  the motorcycle driver was cited for illegal lighting  and his vehicle was impounded because his driver s license was not current  according to nunez    gt   it exceeds the bounds of all human decency   said family attorney edward ramsey  an officer has the discretion to stop or not stop a funeral procession if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  he didn't stop the funeral procession  all he did was stop the unlicensed driver that was breaking the law
good the roads are for the living have your moments at the funeral please 
what s bizarre is this concept of  respect  for the dead by parading the corpse around  or what s left of it after it's been embalmed that shit is just fucking weird burn it and get on with it don't fuck up an interstate just because of your idiotic traditions 
the entitlement attitude of so many americans  gt  if it was me  i would have probably escorted this procession to the burial  your funeral escort was driving without a valid license the chp was correct to pull him over and cite him the rest of the funeral procession was free to continue on but you chose to pull over instead that was your own decision that caused you to be late the funeral  what is so aggravating to me about this is the family will file a lawsuit and probably win they will get to think they are right but they will milk the taxpayers of thousands of dollars

they are just misunderstood they did this for free sex toys 
the man is a wellmeaning but ideologically obsessed idiot the government has handled this clusterfuck extremely well  and i am not one to say that lightly

mmmmmm i need some of the bundy range fed beef i hope the feds seize it all soon and put it up for sale 
so anyone knows how long a trial like this could last 
well then that s that 
does this mean that harry reid s son s land deal can finally go through 

disclaimer  i think obama should nominate someone  and the senate should hold confirmation hearings but this article does not accurately describe most republicans  statements on this issue  the vast majority of republican statements  although  notably  not the cruz one cited in the article  carefully phrase the issue as whether a nominee has been  nominated and confirmed  in the president s last year in office  although kennedy was confirmed in 1988  he was nominated by reagan at the end of 1987  so he doesn't fall under this definition 

either way the process will be dragged out until after the elections the gop have the votes in the senate to say no and would rather gamble in 2016 they at least had the decency to inform everyone of what exactly they're doing this time around 
republicans have always battled with severe cases of selective amnesia 
politics were so different back then people on both sides had to at least pretend to be reasonable  http  wwwnytimescom19871112usreagannominatesanthonykennedytosupremecourthtml  pagewanted  all

somehow i thought this would be about them working in place of strikers  the usual meaning of  cross the picket line  which i did think was an odd choice for s first date for anyone curious here is the full quote  from hillary  around which the article is based ethical or not  your choice  i'm just providing the quote for those who don't feel like clicking  gt  we both had wanted to see a mark rothko exhibit at the yale art gallery but  because of a labor dispute  some of the university s buildings  including the museum  were closed as bill and i walked by  he decided he could get us in if we offered to pick up the litter that had accumulated in the gallery s courtyard watching him talk our way in was the first time i saw his persuasiveness in action we had the entire museum to ourselves we wandered through the galleries talking about rothko and twentiethcentury art i admit to being surprised at his interest in and knowledge of subjects that seemed  at first  unusual for a viking from arkansas we ended up in the museum s courtyard  where i sat in the large lap of henry moore s sculpture drape seated woman while we talked until dark 
small government 
let s clarify this headline  during bush  13  more people joined the government payroll under obama  it continued to grow  but only by 8   the obama years have more federal employees than the bush years the government did not get leaner  it simply got bigger slower 
yea  the gop are such hypocrites 

i ve never met anyone in real life that knows who elizabeth warren is  which is unfortunate 
if he goes up against hillary he just might win it 
classy  isn't the president normally reserved on giving their opinion of the upcoming general election 
i noticed the  math  is only based on loss of tax revenue  and doesn't take into account his proposed spending cuts i feel as though i'm missing a good amount of context here 
i d like to know how he intends to cut  860 billion from the budget each year 
is there any logical reason to support this  or do cruz supporters just not understand the issues 
maybe a subliminal attack on cruz

thank you  gop  for making me think of cruz whenever i hear  canada   yet another thing you spoiled for me

maybe the full title is morning again in  north  america 
i don't know if this is a dig at cruz or a rubio facepalm 


he was polling at like 35  among hispanics a few months ago with his recent surge i wouldn't be surprised if he was tied with her or even ahead now 
this should be trump s theme song wherever he goes  https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  trujr8evgbg

ok guys  i love bernie but this is a random unscientific online poll that is about as meaningful as a poll of reddit users 
kennedy having been nominated in 1987 to fill a vacancy created in 1987 a vacancy extended due to the rejection of robert bork for purely ideological reasons  got ta suspect a lot of rs remember that their sc nominees since bork almost always get hassled and delayed but the dem nominees got free rides this time around  why should they let a judge on the court that ll put a liberal majority on the court  it's not dems are gon na just let a president cruz appoint a conservative to replace ginsburg  this has all been building up for years since the dems stopped robert bork 
i see the paid trump whores have arrived 

this was actually pretty awesome and holy crap  trump was right  the press won't mention or talk about all the terrible foul language the protester used against everyone and how she started swinging at everyone calling it now  tonight or tomorrow headline stories of  trump brings rally members to the stage to praise them for manhandling tiny female protester with excessive force 
this is great  what a bunch of high energy individuals who want to see their country become great again  there s an authenticity in these men and their support for trump that i don't think any of the other candidates  besides bernie  are even close to and it speaks to trump s character  to let them come and take the mic  and show us the viewer  that trump is real  he inspires  and he's a genuine guy that truly believes in the messages he preaches  and wants to improve the lives of the average american citizen 
trump is the best
these people drive me nuts go support your own candidate or maybe protest outside the event why fuck it up for everyone else who wants to be there  attention   money    http  media2snbcnewscomjmsnbccomponentsvideo__newf_dc_trumpaud_151012nbcnewsfp1200800jpg

it has been almost 40 years since the love canal  and this is still happening we need to make some changes to  politics as usual 
welcome to the information age  where your past words and exploits are but a click away and your facts and arguments that played so well to a captive audience  are disseminated and refuted within 24 hours and before they've had their chance to sway voters 
perhaps this is a reminder of what may happen when we expand government to do  everything   little considering that taxpayers don't have enough money for  everything  i wonder what the city  county  and national governments associated with flint have spent on projects over the last 20 years that were less important than replacing lead pipes that bring water into people s homes  or understanding that the chemistry of drinking water is indeed important when lead pipes are still extant you can try to make this a democrat  republican  liberal  conservative issue  but it's really a demonstration of how government systems can go wrong when the servants of the people lose interest in their service  and the people lose sight of demanding government do basic things before it starts doing political things 

even more infuriating is that the government lets wealthy and well connected criminals get away with things like poisoning the water supply 
send the military and the plumbers in rip that water system apart and replace it i know that will still take a while  but the city is in ruined condition major overhaul required
2016 0 1 6 but this a failure on the government of flint  not the free market  from what i've seen the free market has actually been doing a lot to offset some of horrible conditions there i don't know how many articles i've seen of celebrities donating free water to flint for publicity  including bernie himself 
reno nevada is a lot like vegas but  but with more meth use and higher minimum wages seriously  the city is so diverse we put the biggest in our people and little in our wieners if you think reno just a joke than you should probably take down to mexico i bet you didn't know that reno is reindeer in spanish and if you try to leave us you just might vanish reno is like a monkey going branch to branch one second you're here and then at mustang ranch at that ranch there s really no horses just a lot of men with a lot of divorces  i don't think anyone who is from nevada will read this article and take much away from it 
only 82  upvoted  wow 
all any gop politician had to do is remark how they look forward to president obama s nomination to fill this important position and hope and pray he will select a person that s a compromise between their and his views then claim any brought forward are too far to the left of  central  america view over and over until president obama s final year is up  now all you can do is hold you're breath while the rest of america goes blue 
 nevertheless  tillis put a high bar on what kind of nominee the party should be willing to consider  saying a nominee with an identical resume and capabilities of justice scalia  would be worth a vote 

wow i finally found something about bernie sanders that pisses me off touche 
this this is what made you think you're obstructionists  
maybe jesse jackson should return the favor 
jesse jackson failed at two presidential campaigns unlike almost every other failed presidential candidate  however  he singlehandily made the democratic party what it is today 
i am not a jesse jackson fan i think he is a charlatan not because he's black because he's a charlatan 

who did hillary endorse 
election day is on taco tuesday 
not even a group or specific names just  community leaders   this is what qualifies as good in rpolitics
but warren still missing in action 
wish the article was more in depth this was interesting  though  if sure to raise hackles   gt  sanders  success today shows that much of america is tired of rising inequality and these socalled political changes  and intends to revive both a progressive agenda and the american tradition of egalitarianism hillary clinton  who fought to the left of barack obama in 2008 on topics such as health insurance  appears today as if she is defending the status quo  just another heiress of the reaganclintonobama political regime  if you haven't read picketty s  capital in the 21st century  it's definitely worth it 
27 upvotes and no comments  must be a shitty article inflating bernie somehow   reads headline  ooooh  it's a shitty article shilling the fact that a latino supports bernie  take that hillary  where is your minority support now  edit  s


gt  hillary clinton  who fought to the left of barack obama in 2008 on topics such as health insurance  appears today as if she is defending the status quo  i felt obama was going to be more liberal than hillary  was i wrong to think that in 2008 

i will be really satisfied if the final presidential nominees are bernie sanders and donald trump because it means the system isn't completely broken and we're only offered the choices of gop or goplite 

i don't know why anyone ever claimed it was  considering how little polling was done in that state 
so  as a black mixed race person  this is super offensive  race is a social construct bubba get a clue 
and we're all a bit woman  too  so we might as well vote for bernie as a partwoman in the white house 
where can i find more nevada polls  rcp doesn't have that many recent ones 
before i opened the link i bet myself  50 that the economist was gerald friedman steak dinner for me  but seriously friedman is a yesman for sanders  i can find plenty of economists  scott sumner  robert murphy etc  that would strongly disagree with this  edit  his video is full of the usual leftwing talking points  high marginal tax rates led to growth   these arguments have been easily refuted many times  effective tax rates are similar to today  way more deductions and more lenient tax code  only two brackets where the 90  kicked in over 23 million in todays terms etc  the growth statistics he puts forth are not just generous  they are absolutely insane the median income will not grow by 22k  you don't have to be an economist to realize that 
if you mean by race  caucasoid  negroid  mongoloid  and australoid  that is not a true statement the vast majority of people are not of a mixed race 
in other news  sports page editor gives san diego chargers an a for picking ryan leaf in the first round of the 1998 nfl draft

speak for yourself you pathetic weakling 
pretty sure it was a lot more than 7 times 
it just proves the media establishment says most what they would  wish  would happen 
those pundits don't have eighth time 
people think trump is an idiot they are wrong he knows exactly what he is doing
make no mistake donald trump knows exactly what he's doing 
 pundits predicted  is just a hilarious term all by itself pundits will have predicted literally everything that could ever happen  whenever  anything  happens  there will be at least some pundits who predicted  it 

 the revolution will not be televised   http  myoutubecomwatch  v  rgartqrlgy8  gil scott heron



i wish people would stop calling it a political revolution it only brings to mind maoist china when you say it like that 
one weird trick 
bernies revolution has to do with congress and the senate right  thats the main premise of his ability to get his policies enacted  to have a revolution  although im sure the republicans will say its to start a communist revolutionary takeover by playing ads with the soviet national anthem im actually looking forward to what kinds of bullshit they will try and throw at him 
nope  not really
no  its not rpolitics is ruining reddit 
tl  dw  voter turn out numbers this year were  lower  this year in new hampshire than compared to 2008 because 2008 had a much bigger getoutthevote machine with 8 democratic candidates while 2016 only has 2 candidates in absolute terms  bernie sanders shattered the record with 150k votes  with the previous record holder being hillary with 112k votes conclusion  bernie is turning out voters 
the media is telling us  yall are telling us  everybody knows it stop playing this card 
those who take part know it's happening  the fact that mainstream media doesn't report it increases the sense of urgency and help keep the up the spirit while at the same time lull the establishment supporters into a false sense of security so it may actually help 
til  revolution  is getting people to vote for you
apparently reddit doesn't count as the media
and people think the media doesn't know what s best for the country 

from the article  gt  in another punch to jeb bush  donald trump is taking on the establishment gop candidate by purchasing mr bush  s namesake online and redirecting the search to his own campaign website  gt  if an online searcher goes to wwwjebbushcom  instead of going to a site that describes the former florida governor and his quest for the white house  it redirects to mr trump  s campaign website  which promises to  make america great again 
psa  despite his impressive size  he is a  nimble navigator
always an oppressed helpless victim  eh 
really  because i see news stories about bernie sanders all the time 
man  those the media guys sure are jerks why  they even give me a feeling like i'm a victim sometimes 
and hillary clinton still commands an equal if not greater following  but you won't hear that on reddit 
wow  bernie got the most votes in a state with the population of the city of san antonio tx  and hillary won in a state with 3x the population of new hampshire  impressive  not
yes the media  the media  always ominous media who somehow always seems to be in cahoots when they don't report exactly what i want 
old white guy talking on a podium doesn't get much ratings 
federal reservehave fun
 the media is cheating me   every politician ever if you believe it  you're an idiot especially in this case the media actually has massive financial incentive to have a close race between sanders and clinton political ads bring tons of money to television stations  radio stations  etc the closer the race  the more money the candidates are going to spend trying to eek out the victory 
yeah maaan its the freaking media maaan 
voting isn't a revolution call me when there s barricades on the streets  homeslice 
i think the real revolution is towards someone more moderate i've seen inklings of trump s realization of this i think the candidates have made the mistake of running to the extremes kasich could grab into this trend if he had more charisma  the person in the middle in november will win 
tldw  bernie got more votes than any candidate in the new hampshire primary has ever gotten before 
this sounds like it was written by kevin trudeau 
that must mean we have become number one in creating more poor the fastest  gt  the report  released earlier this month  compared the us to other countries in six key areas  gt  employment  gt  poverty  gt  safety nets  gt  wealth inequality  gt  income inequality  gt  wealth inequality and economic mobility  gt  among the ten countries deemed  well off   the us had the gt  lowest overall score  performing particularly poorly on income and wealth inequality as well as safety net effectiveness  the bottom of the top ten and even increasing the number of nations to be compared didn't help  gt  even among a larger cohort of 21 countries  the us still lags  ranking 18th overall 
you ll need a revolution before it can be televised 
because sanders freaks are delusional
 the revolution will not be televised  how prophetic

to be fair  krugman is sort of a dumb guy 

wow  bernie disagrees with poisoning people   just like me      feel the bern
gt  mr sanders said that he didn  t want to be  overly political  but that he had called for the resignation of gov rick snyder of michigan   if the local government can not protect those children  if the state government can not protect those children  then the federal government better   he said  oh really  well you just politicized it dipshit um isn't this a utility and a failure of local government  the federal government would do the exact same thing as the governor and delegate responsibility locally what party was running the city  nevermind i already know the answer  fuck you bernie you're so full of shit 

this title is hilarious  you're all such blowhards the revolution is upon us  the man just doesn't want you to know the man keeping us down
i hope people will learn that he wants to raise their taxes to a ridiculous level and raid their 401k with his  tax wall street speculation  tax this guy is going to make us all poor 
actually the bbc was talking about bernie today i'm torn between being impressed that they're covering it and being driven up the wall by the awful banality and children s tv tone 
this is masterful trolling on trump s part  i'm imagining him giggling with his website guys edit awww its not trump himself it seems  too bad
we don't need em bern it down 
we don't need the media  we have the internet 
hahahahahahahahahahaha
hahahahahahahahahaha

maybe counting signatures isn't his strong suite 
maybe in nevada but overall bernie is polling lower than hillary 
no one is saying he doesn't have an impressive record  they're saying his plans for the future are unrealistic blustering about how great his record is doesn't make his plans any more feasible the right is much closer to a political revolution than the left  we're running interference this time around

well  if elected  she'd be really  really tough on them  you ll see  really  really tough trust her 
good old sputniknewscom 

that story he told today at the rally was heartbreaking had me holding back tears for my fellow michiganders 
i like how when sanders does something it's good and totally not for political reasons however  when clinton does something it's a political side show and she is only doing it to get votes 
i attended this rally today bernie was dead on in his statements regarding flint  and america s larger problems with infrastructure and crumbling  decrepit inner cities i especially liked his proposal to employ jobless americans to repair america s failing public works

the government has horribly failed their citizens what we need now  is bigger government to fix the problem 
im a sanders supporter and the 1st thing i thought of was the communities response when hillary did this  my question is with all his talk wtf is bernie going to do right now not when he wins but right now  if he just talks about it honestly hes no better than hillary
sanders has taken super pacs from microsoft and apple
you don't get to be the 1  by paying for shit with your own money 
i mean  it's 2016 people
if the campaigns aren't allowed to coordinate with the super pacs  then how could clinton even tell them to stop advertising 

i think that krugman simply fails to see what s happening  that sleepy america is gradually waking up to the fact that its system of government is badly broken and has to change krugman is a very smart economist  but he's looking at things through the prism of  business as usual  bernie s underlying premise is that  business as usual  has failed government needs to change  and he is leading the call for change it is about  the will of the people 
she always says to point to examples where she gave out favors  but isn't the _lack_ of doing anything really a favor  sanders always points out how nobody has gone to jail after the crash  and they also happened to spend millions of dollars in dc as well 
whether im in one of my libertarian moods or proconsumer liberal moods  im proud to always disagree with paul krugman

too bad sanders isn't part of the legislative branch  then he just might be in a position to do something about it 
the internet is included in media and his  revolution  is covered enough but it's nice to be the underdog i suppose 
the media won't tell me  wow huffington post  washington post  and most the internet are so far up sander s ass hole that they are telling me he shits gold and that they see it for themselves waaaaaaay up there  all i hear about is the bern regardless of if he's great or not  don't feed me that shit about the media not talking about him  bull fucking shit 
judging by her picture  she won't have to worry about any man getting a woody she's definitely a twobagger 
sanders clearly has  happy dreams   why else would he pay his interns less than the  15hour minimum wage he wants to force on the country 
i d rather hear more about this than trump whining about cruz  here is what i want to hear how bernie is going to fix flint so that it doesn't happen in any other american city 
what a fucking twat 
the comments from the parent about the decline in their child s ability to focus and do their schoolwork was heartbreaking  the fact is that the local and state government decided to turn their heads how much did the federal government know  and how long ago  all these government officials turning their heads and acting like this whole situation is frightening to say the least why did they do it  special interests  lobbyists  was it because the majority of the community was poor and they figured nobody would care  was it racially motivated  all of the above  one has to wonder if this is happening elsewhere in the us these political officials don't give a rat s ass about communities that don't contribute to their campaigns  it's time for a change 
man  i don't know how many of yall get stuck listening to conservative radio  but why are like half of their ads about ed meds why do so many conservative men have trouble getting it up 
not to mention flint is in a state surrounded by fresh water 
can we just go ahead and change the name from rpolitics to rilovebernieandsodoeseveryoneelse
i love how clinton does this and it's obviously pandering to blacks because you know  she's racist and the devil but sanders does it and it's a great thing  what a champion of the little people    viva la revolution   
i mean cmon ppl its 2016

really the clinton campaign  doesn't  have the funds first  they spend 3040  on polling alone second  their base cost for their expansive campaign  salaries  daily promotionals  etc  is really high that s like another 30   now consider that something like 65  of their donors are already maxed outso there s no returning to the well there she has a cash flow problem  which is why she's starting to draw the superpac money into the race

got it hillary goes to flint  to see the people and condemms the situation vote grabbing just trying to get the checkoff for minorities and articles calling her out saying it was for other reasons sanders goes to flint  because he's a great man and condemms the situation  goodness out of his own heart and ttly not related to his political aspirations 
looking at the election now  i don't know if there is a single republican hillary can beat if trump is the nominee  he can play the same  self paid  card  hit her on benghazi  emails  bill  i'm scared 
to be fair  krugman s a staunch neoliberal so of course he's going to speak out against bernie s economic plans
out of 300 million people in this country  we have 2 families that have legacies in the top office tell me it ain't rigged 

no one actually cares  no republican  be they voter or legislator  gives a shit about whether there s precedent for stalling like this  and most of them aren't even pretending to does it prevent obama from achieving his agenda  then they're for it it's that simple

this isn't the same thing bill and hillary are married i assume probably met doing something politically active  and they grew together and nurtured each other s careers it's not surprising that both of them would dedicate their lives to politics and potentially both reach the top  the bushes  on the other hand  are related by blood  not by common interest in that case it's more like a hereditary ruler  what the op means by  close family member

so it's a couple of links deep in this article  but if you go into the american gaming association s voter information papers that they actually distributed to gaming workers  they gave trump a yellow  green is considered progaming  red was antigaming  the man currently owns a las vegas hotel and casino and they gave him the same gaming rating as bernie sanders and the only reason they gave sanders a yellow is because  information not available  what an absolute sham the trump name literally is a part of the vegas skyline and this organization is trying to make trump out to be wishywashy on gaming 
that  casino voter guide   http  bigassetshuffingtonpostcomnvcasinovoterguidepdf  is pure garbage here are some highlights   hillary is designated  opensupportive  of gaming  apparently for paying some recent  lukewarm lip service to casino moguls this is despite her opposition to casinos when she was first lady of arkansas  which is mentioned first in the guide    ben carson is designated  opensupportive   and ted cruz is designated  mixed   but they have the same views  that it's up to individual states whether to allow gambling   cruz apparently loses points for saying the government shouldn't subsidize casino owners   bernie sanders is designated  mixed   citing  no information available  i suppose they couldn't be bothered to make a fiveminute phone call to his campaign before printing up these brochures   donald trump is designated as  mixed   apparently because his atlantic city casinos went bust  along with the rest of ac s local economy   it's mentioned that trump currently operates a hotel on the vegas strip  but no bonus points appear to have been awarded for this

it s the post never trust the post i don't even like hillary clinton  but if you guys are at the point where the new york post  a murdoch owned tabloid  is considered a legitimate news source on clinton then there is something seriously wrong with you guys they've been publishing unsubstantiated hit pieces against her for over 20 years  they aren't exactly unbiased 
hillary clinton has never broken a law is that the kind of person you want for president 
imagine how much praise rpolitics would be raining upon this woman if bernie wasn't running 
maybe the author of this article could show an example of a crime worthy of indictment  and why hillary wasn't prosecuted for it  seems to me there s ample political will to prosecute the clinton s for any wrongdoing from the right  so if there s sufficient evidence out there  why isn't it being acted upon  just reporting that other people say there s wrongdoing worthy of prosecution isn't  evidence  of anything other than what that person claimed if ken starr has evidence that a crime was committed twenty years ago  what s he been waiting for

the fact that senate republicans will attempt to block an obama nominee is no surprise what is surprising is the assertion that he shouldn't even attempt to replace justice scalia  even though he has nearly a year left in office it's as though somehow that would be unseemly to leave the supreme court without a tie breaking vote until 2017 is not in the best interest of the country

that s not really a story  it's more of a promise it's not like he's gon na say he's gon na nominate an unqualified candidate 
gt  trump not only pointed out that bush was president on 911 and that the attacks that day count toward his final grade  but he also noted that bush failed to heed intelligence warnings about the pending attack and that his administration lied to the public about weapons of mass destruction in iraq  all of which is common knowledge to the rest of us  but republican political orthodoxy forbids these things from being mentioned aloud trump is just being true to his distaste for political correctness

it s not just obama  but it's kind of funny how our politicians on both sides use the constitution when it helps them and disregard it when it is convenient for them

for anyone interested in the released emails  there is  this thread   https  wwwredditcomrinternetisbeautifulcomments45ygkqsearch_hillary_clintons_emails  over at rinternetisbeautiful it links to an easy search tool from wall street journal  people are already digging out tons of interesting stuff in the comments 
what s sad is that the damage the lead poisoning causes isn't really treatable i've heard that they can kind of remove the lead from a person s body  but the brain damage is irreversible forgot to mention that the damage is done mostly to children  because it stops their brain from developing properly  i first heard about it on npr  it was  this   http  wwwnprorg20160122463929541leadpoisoningdatesbacktoromantimes  interview  this   http  wwwnprorg20151018449747061lessonsfromafighttofixflintswatersupply  one is also pretty good 
can someone explain to me when the  no private servers  policy came into effect 

i think bill clinton is an eloquent speaker and profound thinker i wish he would mount a new topic every day 
i did not have sex with these emails
eli5  we specifically wrote into the system that a president can't serve more than two terms and that after those terms they're still ineligibleforlife for several nonpresidential positions  why isn't there anything about a single familybloodline being ineligible for at least a decent handful of generations after holding the office  it seems like the exact thing that would have been on the founders minds considering they were separating themselves from a country using a monarchy 
it s funny how this sub acted like the gop were assholes for pursuing this issue but now that she's neck in neck with bernie everything is fair game 
regardless of the importance of the story  i have a hard time taking seriously a website that spells  news  with a z 
the egyptians wouldn't wait for the pharaoh to die to fill the pyramids with grain 
that has got to be the first god damn thing he's said that sounds sane the whole bit was very rational 
this  and another article  really describe to me the difference between clintonera thought and sanders thought clinton economics is to have unfettered capitalist coupled with biggovernment welfare in the form of transfer payments to those harmed by capitalism sanders favors a more fair form of capitalism that is restrained  designed to not allow people to become billionaires instead of transfer payments funded by taxes  he would rather see more opportunities with their cost baked into the pricing of goods and services  i prefer the sanders approach because it is tenable everyone hates high taxes to fund welfare payments it is better to put more people to work with an economy that is designed to do this rather than one designed to make a few people insanely rich 

wow the pubs sure are getting pretty good at blurting out the things that everybody already knows but denies 
so if republican establishment serves the 1  and democrat establishment serves the 10   1  inclusive   that leaves the 90  without any representation sounds like a cause for revolution to me it's just a republicrat money grab and some of you have been fooled to think it's different 
we also had elections for congress and guess who won those  this is the kind of shit that happens when people only vote for president 
they offer the same variation of the time tested outsider vs insider rhetoric that got every president elected since the early 90s  in 2008  it was hillary the beltway insider vs obama the political outsider  in 2000  george bush was the real american  down to earth folk that gets hardworking citizens  in 1992  bill clinton was the american dream he pulled himself from poverty up to the hallowed halls  and earned his way into yale law  now in 2016  we have two candidates who tapped into that same vein and using that rhetoric to get into power it is empty promises and platitudes that amount to nothing when they have to deal with people who disagree with them on a fundamental level 
there s more than one democrat in the georgia senate 
thank you  captain obvious 
education is the solution of draining money from the poor in order for a few of them to be considered for the job of becoming corporate slaves 
looks like this dude got berniesplained 
i do not like hillary clinton but this shit is so fucking weak she is not riding on the coattails of her family she is not from a political family she and bill formed a partnership without this marriage does bill clinton ever become president  i don't believe so hillary is not bill s child she is her own person a person who has worked hard to get where she is now stop equating her with the bushies there is no clinton dynasty at least not yet 
this rpolitics browbeating is becoming really grating 
this is the perfect summation of jeb  s campaign and trump s treatment of him 
he was supporting someone like clinton until now 
oh ya  lets just pretend the dems didn't do the exact same thing when bush was in office 
as a georgian going to the morehouse rally this evening  i'm very happy about this 
its funny i thought this a was a democrat proposing this just goes to show extreme upwards towards authoritarian the wings of the democratrepublican bird go up now
i am i the only one who think that this is the opposite of the point i want people to support bernie because the majority of the democratic party members want to support him i do not want people flipping their support without counting a single vote in georgia 
hillary clinton is going on to rival edward snowden and enjoys the high potential for presidency and support from the biggest banks in the world while anyone in her position would ve had to run off to moscow  never to return  much like snowden himself 
are the two bush presidents rooting for different people 
and democrats would stonewall the fuck out of them  what else is new 
i think that allowing this is a bad idea isn't this how dynastic instead of democratic 
people of my generation have to die before any progress can be made i'm 64 and an atheist  progressive there aren't many of me all the old religious hacks have to die before common sense can prevail 
well duh seriously  they just need to drop the act  we're going to block anyone obama picks because he's a democrat and we're republicans and we don't want them gaining any more power it's politics  just say it we already know it  seriously  i would respect them more if they would quit pretending it has something to do with the american people choosing 
yeah well welcome to a 2 party system
well this vast right wing conspiracy is really getting out of hand surely they would have stopped at several dozen emails but noooooo they planted hundreds  and hundreds  and hundreds of classified documents on her personal server  just to be sure that their sinister plan would succeed well played  vast right wing conspiracy well played 
this article is a pure piece of innuendo in which the only source cited by the author are previous writings by the author  and yet hillary haters will inglorious that to spin a tale  just as the author does
gt  trump holds the support of one in three evangelical voters  33 percent  oh  i get it now  those are the hard core evangelicals who want to hasten judgement day trump is their protest vote against this earthly planet
pretty cool kingdom we have
this article reflects the rightwing conspiracy that started 45 years ago to thwart the first woman president from taking office 
here is a 43page report by the nonpartisan congressional research service which analyzes tax rates since 1945 and shows  unequivocally  that trickle down is a big  fat lie  http  wwwdpccsenategovfilesdocumentscrstaxesandtheeconomy  20top  20ratespdf
one problem that will need to be addressed before even mr sanders  economic prescriptions can work  our currency is overloaded  in a computer program  if the programmer tries to do too many things with one variable  the result is sure failure humans overload their currencies in the same way and to the same result  they try to make their currencies do too many things at the same time a medium of exchange  a medium of wealth storage  a means of demonstrating success  etc this can be fixed by using specific currencies for specific things  a saving currency  a trading currency  an investment currency  etc make tax policies specific to the uses of the various currencies and to their conversions from one type to another this would require secure electronic currencies  on a related note  what is a good way to really screw up a government  hoard their currency or otherwise take it out of circulation  the us and other governments are experiencing this now as multinational corporations stash currencies in outofreach banks governments are foolish to allow these people  aka  corporations   to undermine their currencies in this manner 
itt  but he's from france 
let s be real  george washington would be sickened by this bullshit the man left office after two terms for a reason 
most recently  hillary seems to be making her platform   i'm just like bernie  but i can actually succeed   which feels increasingly desperate 
i miss the old hillary  straight from the go hillary chop up the soul hillary  set on her goals hillary i hate the new hillary  the bad mood hillary the always rude hillary  spaz in the news hillary i miss the sweet hillary  chop up the beats hillary i got ta to say at that time i'd like to meet hillary see i invented hillary  it wasn't any hillaries and now i look and look around and there s so many hillarys i used to love hillary  i used to love hillary i even had the pink polo  i thought i was hillary what if hillary made a song about hillary called  i miss the old hillary   man that would be so hillary that s all it was hillary  we still love hillary and i love you like hillary loves hillary
gt  the group s voter guide would probably pass muster in the precitizens united days  says larry noble  a lawyer for campaign legal center and former general counsel for the federal election commission  so the article is saying that  citizens united  has very little to do with this ability to essentially endorse candidates  before  citizens united   there was nothing wrong with a corporation saying  hillary clinton hates puppies   because the law drew a line at  hillary clinton hates puppies and you shouldn't vote for her  i'm not really sure that makes a huge difference 
corruption  corruption  corruption
everyone hates the senate no matter who is in charge of it need term limits 
doesn't seem like what you want to say if you are trying to get people to come to bernie 
almost 
dddynasty 
nepotism at its worst 
who is the other president bush supporting 
political dynasties are the worst 
article is so wrong trump isn't against free trade he's only saying that free trade should go both ways he wants to pressure china  japan  mexico  etc to open up trade on their side instead of taxing our goods to oblivion and manipulating their currency 
i misread the headline  and thought bill was pushing hillary for scotus 
not bad for theguardian i like the last bit about the dogma of the left   education is the solution to all problems   not when preaching the wrong thing  edit  which was what the article was getting at  il admit i spedread
while i of course like the title  we should probably disregard nypost articles 
this is the 2nd national poll since nh that real clear politics refuses to put up 
our government has basically been a twofamily system  not just a twoparty system it shows how undemocratic our democracy really is

carson surprised me for once 
the mother of all cherrypicked polls 
fort has lots of enemies in both parties hahaha he's a prominent figure but not that prominent some would say he's a joke 
gt  french economist
don't forget bernie s uncle  colonel 
checks and balances bitch 
the south is proving to be just as incestuous as ever 
to me  hillary appears to be a government employee looking for the promotion she feels she earned  contrarily  bernie appears to me to be a civil servant seeking to serve a larger electorate  such perspectives will naturally guide campaigns 
plenty of blame to go around both sides are dickheads we need a viable third party  preferably libertarian in nature 
i'm pretty sure carson doesn't know what the word ideologue means 
 well mlk was black  and bernie is white also  mlk is dead  and bernie is alive i also understand they're both fans of a good turkey sandwich  annnnd that s about it 
no no no no no no no no no noooooooooooooooo  please no 
fuck s sake people  i'm a bernie fan and have never liked hillary  but this is getting absurd 5600 upvotes for an essay that offers absolutely nothing new of substance  and is just a retread of an established talking point for the past two months 
sanders  campaign is about us hillary s campaign is about her  can't imagine the latter would be inspiring to anyone other than monarchists 
oh come on who the hell did you think george and bill were going to support in this election  the author acts like if we have 2 presidents from the same family our whole political system is fucked and that instantly turns us into a monarchy  also  what s up with the jeb bush hate recently  the guys so far down in the polls  does anyone even care about him at this point 
this is literally an opinion article and doesn't belong here 
it is  after all  the present year 
anyone else love dominos 
i pray nightly that chicago never has a third mayor daley 
i ll take crazy uncle bernie  thanks 

and in a country that threw off kings and queens and inherited nobility  they can both shove it 
if you go to rhillaryclinton alot of people are referring to her as queen hillary this isn't a god damn monarchy 
why is it i keep get getting good news about bernie and bad news about hillary on reddit  seriously any hillary followers on here 
this isn't rcirclejerk 
can we please have more substantive discussions on why bernie sanders  ideas are the best ideas  i tend to agree with him  but at this point we have pretty much saturated reddit with these posts link to econometric articles  or tax policy articles  etc 
fucking disgusting 
note  article title is irony

pfffffffft    what a maroon  s
bush was president during 911 though 
good lord  this subreddit is so one sided it's kind of sad 
why do republicans continue to defend the failure that was the george w bush presidency
has bernie sanders ever run a business  is he aware that in some businesses  the government gets 80 cents to the dollar  that s outrageous 
in a way  this is how government is supposed to work  she's going to change her stance to represent the will of the people in order to win the election  because the election system essentially demands that  what i'm concerned with is which ideals politicians will pander to  when politicians say that they think pp will make partial birth abortions mandated for all people  i want to hate that politician and their voters  when politicians say that they think gay marriage should be legal  but they didn't think that before  of course i'm going to be suspect of their opinion but i am glad that they changed their mind to that stance  and i'm glad the voters put that pressure on 
i just wanted to point out that the thumbnail is goatse
you mean like unions have been  since their inceptions 
did we just get punked by the british   
first time for everything 
can anyone post a similar situation for hillary  probably not we  the people  know who should win the dnc nomination
of course is this really not common knowledge  do people really not realize it's an attempt to let a republican president nominate someone 
gt  then again  recognize that the two picks that the president has selected are ideologues  so there  s really no reason to believe that his next pick wouldn  t be an ideologue also  a  we'd have to go back to anthony kennedy probably to find a supreme court nominee who wasn't an ideologue  and even then  most were surprised kennedy s voting record turned out to be moderate  b  the president hasn't picked yet therefore no one knows if this pick  who does not yet exist  is an ideologue  or not no one knows who it is  no one has had a chance to examine the person s record no one has had a chance to interview the person and to find out their thoughts and positions  basically  obama could pick someone so conservative that they make scalia seem like a bleedingheart liberal  and the republicans would still be opposed no on substance  but because its obama s pick they are opposed to everything obama does because obama did it they disagree with much of what obama does for substantive reasons  of course  but with all of it for the childish reason of trying to prevent obama from doing anything at all  even when they agree with him 
how close can the bush brothers be  they don't even have the same accent 
bernie sanders and the whitehouse  if you think the two don't go together  you're not alone but you're also wrong  not that he would hold that against you because sanders  with apologies to the democrats  barack obama  is perhaps the nicest and most sincere man in politics and has been for 40 years  walk through congress with sanders before the gates open and you ll see him greet the security guards and ushers by name sit near the podium during fillibusters and you ll hear him call out to the lobbyists watch him afterward and you ll find him standing patiently by his locker  respectfully answering the lamest questions from reporters representing the smallest hometown newspapers  that wasn't something you would see with hillary clinton  clinton would question your parentage  sanders will ask about your kids  then listen intently to the answer  when the supreme court held a memorial service for justice scalia  sanders flew to texas to see his family  then flew right back to take part in the service never mind that it was his only day off in a month  it's just respect   sanders said  yet a politician who shows respect to everyone doesn't always see it in return  clearly sanders lacks the glitz and glamour  the flamboyance and the egotism to stand out in a tabloid world which is why he's thought of primarily as a nice guy and not a great politician  truth is  he's both  he's also crew cuts and blue collars he's middle america  right down to the  please  and  thank you  in his world  guns are for hunting  not for carrying into night clubs  no wonder the license plate on his pickup truck  what else would he drive   once read dbth  shorthand for don't believe the hype  but you can believe the numbers  which make a strong case that sanders should be the president  in this case  a nice guy should finish first 
the actual story here is pretty neat and only solidifies my affection for bill
is there a recording of the speech somewhere 
and we chose who gets to affirm the choice when the senate was won by republicans in 2014 
  fondle the bern suck the bern feel the bern   basically what rpolitics feels like lately
tbh i'm much more concerned about the bushes than i am about hillary  they exemplified privilege and had their careers completely supported by their network  hillary has at least worked for it 
 mr trump will not be president  says increasingly nervous man for the seventh time this year
wow this is hilariously over the top a sweet anecdote about their first date is spun into a tale of antilabor scabs totally totally ridiculous  this hillarybashing is really getting embarrassing for the hillaryhaters 
come on op  have a little courtesy by keeping this kind of onesided discussion in bernie s subreddit 
say what you will about him but i think we all need to recognize a champion of the people and a senator who is attempting to make our democracy work for the people he represents 
illegal or not  she should have known better common sense should tell you that business in a classified environment should stay in that environment people who forget this at the very least aren't trusted with classified information and dont get to work in those environments any longer  some go to prison for their transgressions 

the aca is better than what we had before  but it's still far from a good system millions of people still have no access to health care because they can't afford the insurance premiums even people with decent insurance are going bankrupt because of deductibles  copays and expensive premiums the insurance industry doesn't give a shit about our health it's time to get rid of the health insurance industry it should not exist it is just a parasite 
you know what is the current situation with healthcare in america   44 million people in this country do not have health insurance   33 million more are under insured   29 million adults fall into the medicaid coverage gap in which 89  are from the south 45  are white 41  are full time workers 26  are from texas  source   http  kfforghealthreformissuebriefthecoveragegapuninsuredpooradultsinstatesthatdonotexpandmedicaidanupdate  this is obamacare this is the aca  i think  and i believe many would agree  that hillary s  i'm going to build on the aca  is really  i'm going to make sure the health insurance industry remains a critical part of our healthcare system  whether or not medicare for all  single payer is  the  solution to our healthcare crisis  it is something worth pursuing throw out those who wish to keep the status quo 
if medicaid expansion had been mandatory as in the original law  i think obamacare would be doing a much better job  however complying with the regulations made the private insurance market pretty brutal as far as sticker shock goes the new normal is a highdeductible plan  which incurs a lot more out of pocket lump payouts trying to meet that deductible if you  have health insurance  with a  3000 deductible  you can still easily go bankrupt when that bill hits  if not immediately then somewhere along the journey to your  10000 out of pocket maximum for the year  i have a middleclass job but the only way i could pay for the outofpocket expenses to treat my wife s cancer was borrowing from my 401k  most people aren't so lucky  situations like this are just so unfuckingnecessary that it's incredibly frustrating if america can't figure out affordable universal healthcare like every other wealthy country  then america isn't that freaking great 
how can one vote for a man who didn't receive his first paycheck until he was 40 years old 

i'm pretty sure dick cheney was president on 911 
oh thank goodness we have the economic and political wisdom of peter funt i don't know what we'd do without the son of a television pioneer  and possible pervert  
aw shit it must be the end times  because i agree with everything ben carson said in that article
even a broken clock is right twice a day 
with all due respect to mr jackson  he has a misunderstanding of young voters grasp on hrcs history 
http  wwwmotherjonescompolitics201505youngberniesanderslibertyunionvermont
i respect him for being honest about this are we really expecting politicians to lie to us  that s terrible 
interesting piece of data from this poll  gt  while sanders has drawn a significant portion of his support from the youngest voting bloc  under the age of 30   just 25 percent of millennial black voters said they are supporting the vermont senator  compared with 64 percent who said they are backing clinton the reverse is true among white millennials  who support sanders 75 percent to 22 percent  this doesn't really conform with the media narrative i wonder if there are other polls with similar results 
small government my ass   
gt  it's very important in the long run  to elect a woman for president    says 53yearold lisa mcallister  i think we've seen that with president obama  that he's brought racial issues to the forefront that we need to have at the forefront it's more than women s turn to have a woman in the white house    obama has not brought racial issues to the forefront   whatever attention is being paid to racial issues in this country is entirely due to people recording instances of police brutality towards black people and circulating them online black lives matter would not exist if not for these recordings the fact that black lives matter exists at all during an obama presidency is a sign that he hasn't done anything nearly enough to address racial issues in this country    electing a black president has not solved racism electing a woman president will not solve sexism  
i'm willing to bet that most of hillary supporters  or any nonbernie supporters  who haven't seen a single video of bernie will at least entertain the idea of jumping ship once they do see one of his videos  i like this one in particular   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  ru3nkvvxcss 
not sure we need to be quoting lowinformation voters here five minutes on google will tell you all of the candidates  positions if you're undecided until hearing them speak  frankly  you're a fucking moron 
this sub and the people on it are literally the worst  bernie sanders wipes his mouth politely after eating a sandwich   4500 upvotes  bunch of antitrade  can't do math  think taxes are only paid by businesses  free health care  even though you're 20 and have about a 00001  chance of needing serious medical coverage  wanting morons 
i too think everything should be free for me and paid for by others
just to warn you when you look deeper there s no actionable plan

i think most recognize he is allowed to nominate but the senate is still allowed to deny it
of course not it's all posturing
black voters know that sanders  goals  as good as they might sound  are politically unrealistic hillary is the better choice because at least she will raise the minimum wage to  12  which is more than most people make 
why shouldn't they 
obama only follows the constitution when it suits him 
thanks scotus  scalia was bound and determined to interpret  and not create  the law  which in my opinion is shortsighted we need justices that interpret the law but above all protect the democracy 
good for them  it's pretty amazing that people are upset that the clintons picked up litter that the people who were being paid to do so refused to do  it's like many people always say if they feel the compensation for the job isn't fair  quit and find a job that s more in line with what they feel they should be getting  if they can't find a job that pays what they think they are worth  perhaps they are overestimating the value of the skills they bring to the table  i'm aware this article was submitted as an attack piece  but the story makes bill clinton look awesome 
 well  at least they're not filibustering to keep the other party s majority from voting   http  articleschicagotribunecom20060130news0601300193_1_filibusterjudgealitoconfirmation 
 carson said the supreme court has become a  political tool   adding that it might be time to look at term limits for the justices  holy fuck  ben carson just said something i actually  agree  with feels weird  man 
reason among the republicans   or does it just look reasonable out of context 
this is a cool story they did nothing wrong it was a creative way to see some interesting art and  in bill s case  a way to impress the girl you like 
this is considered an endorsement
the article makes this claim from a voters guide  given to 200k casino employees which details different candidates positions on the gambling industry half of the article  is asking readers for stories from their workplaces  and  from the article   the american gaming association doesn't fully embrace its ability  courtesy of citizens united  to endorse candidates the group s voter guide would probably pass muster in the precitizens united days  says larry noble  a lawyer for campaign legal center and former general counsel for the federal election commission  huffington post is making up their own shit to be outraged about at this point 
and thus  the birth of the tea party 
well we could take down the healthcare monopolies and then allow for capitalism to way down the cost allowing for healthcare providers to compete statewide would help these two would see a cost reduction and open up insurance to people who may not be able to afford it now i doesn't have to be universal health care to work  it just can't have the monopolies they have now 
 sips coffee  but thats none of my business 
never trust anything from the huffington post or anything resembling it 
lucid dreaming ftw 
vote 
funny how truth is self evident wherever you find it 
i saw trump speak and he said stuff that sounded good too his voice and personality wow  he's so passionate 
god damnit  mitch mcconnel is so mcawful that he's making me agree with ben carson  fuck off  you obstinate turtle 
she cared   more   about his passionoratory not about the content 

gt   there will be no cooperation for the rest of the year   march  2010 senator and former republican presidential nominee john mccain after the affordable health care act passed 
obama was a great speaker  passionate  and spoke of change  but history is useless  clearly  if no one remembers it in 8 years 
in the 1960s just before the government got involved in health care the cost of full coverage health insurance would be 20 dollars a month after inflation today 
uhh i have a great idea  let's get ken starr back and give him unlimited power and tons of money to investigate endlessly and if he takes long enough maybe she will get caught having sex with an intern and all the little trolls can say  see i told you so  we always knew she did something  we just had to wait long enough for her to actually do it  gotcha  she's not my first choice for president but if she's so damn good at getting away with all the stuff she's been accused of for 30 years  then maybe she'd make a tough and crafty president  in her absence i would nominate the following paragons of virtue  bob livingston  tom delay denny hastert scooter libby newt gingrich irancontra etcetc  yo investigate this  shit happens on both sides of the aisle but since the day bill clinton announced his first run for president  the republicans have redefined the term  witch hunt  if they were half as obsessive about fixing things  we'd all be living in the  real  america we all deserve
there is certainly an age gap going on here it seems as if the only retort that hillary supporters can muster is  young people are too naive to know that they should support clinton  this seems similar to their other arguments  eg  women who support bernie are not real feminists  men who support bernie are sexist  berniebros    considering the incredible skill that young people have in accessing good and relativelyunbiased information quickly using modern technology  the position that young people are naive or underinformed seems to fall flat considering older generations  reliance on outdated information media technologies for their information  media that is largely controlled by corporate clinton supporters  it may be that it is the older generation of voters who are both naive and underinformed  i'd like to hear other people s thoughts on this 
have trickle down economics worked anywhere 

he may win right there  but will that end racism  will that end sexism 
its true  i bet we got more ground game than hillary  when i attended a volunteer seminar recently we had lots of volunteers and almost all of them had never volunteered for a political campaign before  myself included 

 come on  ben  memorize your lines  and say only your lines   marco rubotio
fool me once shame on you  fool meyou can't get fooled again
i see they forgot to keep drugging his coffee 
the turd was praising tpp 
thank you so much presdent obama  you just made more trump supporters  and made him the candidate  there are people that voted for you 2x mr obamathat now support trump 100   as for insulting people that support trump its democracy mr president democracy many people like bill clinton were insulting your supporters when you were running too mr obama  as a trump supporter  sorry that trump triggered you mr president i am sure thats why you are considered a weak president on many issues like isis  terrorism  immigration  and even how divided the country more on race issues blacks think you were a disappointment mr obama  please dont cry again like you literally do  mr obama you are fired in 9 months anyways 
if she wasn't running we could have had cory 
jesus what is this thread  is there a lot more trump supporters here than i thought 
not only did he call the gop a bunch of hypocrites  but he also put forth an argument against the whole conservative ideology at the end lol 

bernie is trying to raise  1m today  from his campaign   today hillary clinton left the campaign trail and is in new york city hosting a fundraiser  raising a grotesque amount of money from a small number of rich people probably at least  500000 let  s double that for bernie before midnight tonight add your contribution today  if you like bernie you should donate   
sell out can't even answer a simple question 
he was doing mental gymnastics there to stay prohillary so he can get whatever hillary promised for being her black representative 
bubba done slipped up again 
gt  and congress should consider  bold solutions  the process of breaking up big banks doesn't involve congress like at all unless you're talking about some other bold solutions that would fix the whole  too big to fail  problem

what happened to carson  
a big reason la is in a pickle is the bottoming out of the oil industry the state budget is made with assumptions on oil prices per barrel 
great work  asshole 
sleepy ben said what everyone already knew  risky bet ben  let's see how it plays out 

this needs to be higher jindal pulled the wool over everyone s eyes for years by shifting money around now the great state of louisiana is spending the lowest on higher education in the nation because we simply don't have any money forget the scholarships  they're not even sure they can keep the universities open anymore 
scabs 
the two top posts on rpoliticsrising   on bill and hillary clinton  s first date in 1971  they crossed a picket line   rodham and clinton were offering themselves as replacement labor  blunting  if only temporarily  the effects of the strike on the university   king  amazing archival video appears to show the arrest of a young bernie sanders as a student activist in chicago
just came here to say bill looks glorious in that photo 
really mods  come the fuck on now 
i note that bernie sanders has   never   gone on a date with bill clinton 
once again people realize that clicking on an article takes too much work to decide how biased the headline actually is
the last economist that i would trust would be a french economist france is not only an economic basket case  it has made a total disaster with it muslim population 
i was taught at a young age  under 10  about not crossing a picket line  but i lived in las vegas with some decent unions would the clinton s have been taught that lesson before they were  20 raised elsewhere in the 60 s 

this is in striking contrast to sanders who got arrested on his college campus for protesting segregation practices 
jesus fucking christ they were'nt going in as scab workers bill lied about cleaning up the place to get in so he could have an evening alone with his lady this is like a scene from a shitty romantic comedy  not some insightful view into the clinton s neocon leanings for fucks sake can we concentrate on actual fucking issues and not try to convince each other that america s most prominent family of civil servants is evil because their names aren't bernie and sanders 
id love to hear trumps reaction 
well they don't have to do that anymore now they ll just get 600k for reading off a speech 
this thread is a disaster  
how is that a date   
socialism is nice until you run out of other people s money 
if there s one thing the french are known for  its their economists  just look at that vibrant french economy 
his bestseller really isn't a good book he gets historical facts wrong  uses very arbitrary  and bad  math  and the thesis has been refuted by many economists  and one grad student  
my felllw black citizens  here   https  myoutubecomwatch  v  azj7f3xgb4  is your champion
i make what some would consider  a lot  of money this policy wouldn't save me enough to make a significant difference in my quality of life  what  would  make a big difference is my country s government going fucking bankrupt

scabs  who d imagine that 
 shows picture of sad child  this is why we need socialism screw your stupid papers and economists
i was told to vote for this woman by my union  iam  but i voted for obama and i will vote for bernie this post leaves a really bad taste in my mouth what hypocrite s they are 
marked as spam 
notable how many economists are coming out in support of sanders 
agree 
france doesn't really have the best economy right now
and there are hundreds of economists who would disagree
you can never discredited rightwing economics enough  it's like a vampire  it doesn't die  it's the undead 
they grow up so fast 
 capital in the 21st century  is a book everybody should read 
gee  i was really worried that rpolitics wasn't taking sanders seriously enough 
til jindal is no longer the gov 
you know the gop  is doomed when fuckface von clownstick is making sense   actually we are all doomed
where can i stream this  i don't have msnbc and i love joe and mika
if the blacks give this to hillary  this liberal bernie loving redditor will vote for trump and let them get what they deserve 
ruh roh 
trump is just on another level love it 
this comment made by obama will only help trump because it elevated him above all the other opponents in south carolina obama basically recognized him as a front runner by making this statement 
 who s the president of the united states    ronald reagan   hah  an actor  then who s the vice president  jerry lewis  
meanwhile hillary makes barking noises on camera 
has obama ever even had a private sector job in his life 
yep very serious you literally have to cry on camera to regain your failing support as president  obama just made trump the candidate probably will go up 5  in polls 10  nationally  thank you so much mr obama   yeah  i remember your campaign also mr obama  hope and change  marketing and selling but oh waityou also say that trump is just a great marketershow i dont understand mr obama  are you just a hypocrite  or a bit ignorant  or are you just being a political liar  i thank the sweet baby jesus obama just made trump the candidate because republicans dont like obama and many democrats also dont like obama blacks dont like obama  lol  now you bernie supporters just pray he keeps on kissing the bum of hillary 
nooo  i'm too late to the comments to point out how that number is mdclxvi in roman numerals   
in gon na vote in georgia to make sure bernie wins    that man is amazing 
is this rsandersforpresident 

bernie needs to win nevada 
why pollsters assume a youge black turnout  according to cnn poll  hillary leading among blacks  6528  meanwhile bernie leads among whites  5440   overall result is 5638  so if turnout ratio is 5050 hillary should lead by 65 points  52546   why in the earth black folks will turnout for hillary more than they did for obama back in 2008 primaries

imagine if obama were to nominate hillary that would be a nuclear move she could never win a nomination though 
people need to study sanders as a moderate  i was really convinced by sander s voting record and consistency in the past two decades if sanders wins  i know what kind of president we are going to get 
universal health care means that everyone has health care universal coverage means everyone has to interact with an insurance company instead of a health care professional  if you're sick do you want to see a doctor or an actuary 
i'm probably going to be shouted down for this  but i have to say  it's not congress s job to enable the president s agenda it is rather the president s job to faithfully execute the laws congress passes  if it decides to pass any so  yes  they've obstructed his goals in office  but that s their prerogative likewise  while you and i may dislike it  if congress decides to attempt to hamper his goals in whatever ways its powers allow it to  that s part of the checks and balances present in the constitution  there s no clause in there saying   but if congress  really  won't play ball and you  really  want to do something  ignore them and do it anyway  that being said  he is free to tell them they are assholes if he wishes  honestly  i'm happy to see a relatively inactive congress the us code is long enough 
i love arguing politics with coworkers
he's a better politician than hillary  a ridiculous number of bernie supporters seem to love the guy and don't realize how deep in bed with the financialbanking industry he is 
he is right he was part of the obstruction back when he was in the senate when the democrats tried to delay bush s nomination until the next president was elected same shit  different year 
ben carson doesn't want to be president  he wants to make a good show of things so he can charge tons of money in speaking fees that s called  pulling a palin  
insurance is supposed to only cover catastrophic costs  it's not supposed to cover your  20 subscriptions that s not what insurance is  that s one reason why prices are so high  imagine if your car insurance company had to pay for oil changesfluidsinspectionsetc the price would rise dramitically
just for clarification  this is for the state senate still 0 us senators supporting bernie   2016 endorsement tracker   http  projectsfivethirtyeightcom2016endorsementprimary 
lolor it might just mean that  despite a concerted effort for 30 years to connect her from everything from murder to drug running  these aren't real issues 
i guess this guy s word isn't as strong as leahy s what filth
suppose that the gop wins the presidency but the democrats recapture the senate does anyone really think that if the democrats vote down every nominee for 4 years that the republicans will just say   well  that s just the senate doing their constitutional duty to advise and consent boy this is hard  i hope we can find a reasonable agreement on a suitable replacement   hell no  they would rage out  part of why our political system mostly works in this country is that for over 200 years even bitter rivals have been able to act in a manner which reflects respect for civic duty when that broke down once before  more than 600000 people died to resolve the dispute  if the senate doesn't consider nominees to the supreme court in good faith  they risk the entire political system crashing down civil wars have been fought over less than this 
so bill clinton  as a college kid  conned his way into a museum and had it all to themselves  but this is now a story about how bill and hillary were scabs  and therefore can now be construed to be secretly antilabor  this fucking sub has lost all sense of perspective 
keep just these recent decisions in mind where justice scalia was a part of the 54 majority that could have different outcomes if he is replaced by a democrat president   in a 54 majority limits in mccutcheon v fec  the court invalidated the aggregate contribution limits that were first put in place by the federal election campaign act of 1971   in atamp  t mobility v concepcion  the 54 majority ruled that corporations can effectively mandate arbitration agreements that preclude consumers from bringing class actions to combat fraud and enforce their rights without access to an impartial judge and jury  and without the resources to go it alone in arbitration  people typically abandon their claims and corporate wrongdoers are never held accountable many states enacted consumer protection laws to curtail the pernicious practice of forced arbitration  but in concepcion the supreme court held that such laws are preempted by an old federal statute from 1925 called the federal arbitration act  faa    the 54 majority in michigan v epa overturned epa regulations safeguarding communities from toxic pollution by power plants that causes up to 11000 premature deaths each year essentially  the court  s decision places a premium on businesses  bottom lines over public health and limits the epa  s ability to regulate hazardous air pollutants over the objections of corporate interests   in ledbetter v goodyear tire and rubber co  the 54 court majority made it virtually impossible to bring a claim of longrunning sex or race discrimination in pay under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act  a decision later reversed by a congressional statute a woman had been paid less than her male peers for 20 years and the court stated she had no right to bring a lawsuit for equal pay because she failed to file suit within 180 days of the first discrimination  even though she had no way of learning about the discrimination until years later   in davis v fec  a 54 majority overturned the  millionaire  s amendment   congress  s effort to level the playing field in the political process and reduce the influence of wealth on elections by increasing the contribution limits to candidates facing selffunded opponents   in florence v board of chosen freeholders  the 54 court majority ruled that local officials can stripsearch anyone accused of any crime  even if there is no reason to suspect contraband or concealed weapons  and can not be sued for invasion of privacy   the 54 majority in shelby county v holder overturned a key section of the 1965 voting rights act  making it much harder to protect against discrimination in voting not only did the majority dismissively reject tens of thousands of pages of congressional findings supporting the coverage formula contained in section 4 of the nearlyunanimous 2006 reauthorization of the vra  but the opinion was noted for failing to provide any legal or constitutional rationale for its holding nothing in the text of the constitution was cited to justify the court  s novel decision to strike down the cornerstone of american civil rights law   the 54 majority in leegin creative leather products inc v psks inc overruled a 96yearold rule that had made vertical price fixing per se illegal under federal antitrust law overturning the almost century of antitrust law  the court decided that manufacturers and retailers could sometimes engage in pricefixing in dissent  justice breyer cited studies estimating that this change in law would cost consumers  300 billion a year in increased prices on everyday items   a 53 majority  since justice sotomayor recused herself  in american express co v italian colors restaurant ruled that a smallbusiness owner could not bring an antitrust lawsuit challenging a large corporation  s alleged abuse of its monopoly power  even though  it was claimed  it was that very monopoly power that allowed the corporation to force an agreement to arbitrate and not litigate all complaints against it the court upheld the use of forced arbitration clauses even if it made enforcing federal laws like the sherman act practically impossible in dissent  justice kagan explained that the court  s decision allows   t  he monopolist    to use its monopoly power to insist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all legal recourse   the 54 majority in burwell v hobby lobby stores  inc decided that forprofit corporations can claim religious rights and can exempt themselves from federal laws requiring them to provide contraceptive coverage to employees the majority also rewrote the religious freedom restoration act  with potentially dangerous consequences for lgbt and other americans   in parents involved in community schools v seattle school district  the 54 court majority prohibited school districts from attempting voluntarily to promote school desegregation through student reassignment plans   in walmart v dukes  approximately one million female walmart employees tried to file a classaction lawsuit over claims of sex bias the 54 decision by the court made it nearly impossible for a class of workers to use for widespread corporate misbehavior that comes in the form of unwritten policies essentially  every worker has to bring their own individual claim  making walmart and other large companies realistically judgment proof to these types of claim   in two 54 decisions  solid waste agency of northern cook county v us army corps of engineers and rapanos v united states  the court effectively took many waterways outside the protection of the clean water act  even though pollution from these waterways can dirty the drinking water of 117 million americans as a result of the court  s decision  1500 major pollution investigations have been halted  and epa actions against water polluters have fallen by 50    in national federation of independent business v sebelius which upheld the patient protection and affordable care act under the taxing power of congress  a 54 majority on the court overturned 70 years of precedent dealing with the commerce clause prior to this case  the court had held that congress has the authority to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce in the area of economic activities   substantial effect  can be found based on the cumulative impact of the activity across the country for example  the supreme court held that congress could use its commerce clause authority to prohibit individuals from cultivating and possessing small amounts of marijuana for personal medicinal use because marijuana is bought and sold in interstate commerce the relationship between health care coverage and the national economy is even stronger and more readily apparent the court had also said that congress could use its commerce power to forbid hotels and restaurants from discriminating based on race  even though their conduct was refusing to engage in commercial activity under an unbroken line of precedents stretching back 70 years  congress has the power to regulate activities that  taken cumulatively  have a substantial effect on interstate commerce people not purchasing health insurance unquestionably has this effect this ruling  if a liberal justice is replaced with someone like scalia  could overturn vast amounts of social programs like medicare and worker protections  on the other hand  occasionally a justice like justice kennedy has sided with the liberal justices to produce 54 decisions that would be in danger if a republican wins the white house and a liberal justice dies or retires while they are in office   in obergefell v hodges  a 54 court majority ruled that the constitution protects the right of samesex couples to marry   a 54 majority in texas department of housing and community affairs v the inclusive communities project upheld the longstanding interpretation of the federal fair housing act to prohibit practices with unjustified discriminatory impact   in massachusetts v epa  a 54 court majority upheld the authority of the epa to regulate greenhouse gases   a 54 majority upheld voterpassed nonpartisan redistricting reform in arizona state legislature v arizona independent redistricting commission   in williamsyulee v the florida bar  a 54 majority upheld a ban on state judicial candidates directly soliciting campaign funds   in boumediene v bush  a 54 majority ruled that prisoners detained in guantanamo can file habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detention   a 54 majority in alabama democratic conference v alabama invalidated a state redistricting scheme that used race to harm minority voters   a 54 majority ruled in favor of workers  rights in csx transportation v mcbride ruling railroads are liable for workers  injuries under federal statute if the railroad was partially responsible for the injury through its negligence 
gt  when asked by a reporter about his own support of a filibuster of justice samuel alito  then a nominee of president george w bush  obama shot back that  justice alito is on the bench right now  so its okay because he ultimately failed got it

squatting squaw makes big movement
i am surprised that none of the billionaires in this country have thought to give back to an american city in need  the american people would love anyone who could do that public universities and private foundations could compete for the prestige of making flint great again 
in light of scalia s passing  hillary has been doubling down on her claim that she is the more  electable  of the two yet  when those who value trustworthiness flock to bernie s side  by 91  to 5   even that claim is dubious 
it a better wold  all insurance would cover is unforeseeable  catastrophic costs the fact that you need insurance to pay for things that you know you are going to need  checkups  defeats the whole point of insurance 
it s a conspiracy bill set hillary up because he doesn't want to be the first husband 
seems to be a tacit admission to voting based on feelings 
for the people here saying  this will help trump   that s what obama is aiming to do  whoever the democratic nominee is  obama  wants  himher to go up against trump in the general trump is the candidate most likely to selfimplode  even against a meek democratic candidate  let's dispel with this fiction that president obama doesn't know what he's doing 
gt  but back then  cynthia salgado was 9 years old this year  she's getting ready to vote for the first time she was initially going to back to clinton  that was all she knew  fuck  that is the most mindblowing pair of sentences in this article  she was a goddamn nine year old girl back in 2008  and now she's gon na vote the mental image is so mindblowing time flies  man we're all gon na die soon shit 
i'm all registered up and ready to vote in the ga primary on 31 
and so it begins

we have three branches in order to separate powers this is part of it people act like this is something new the legislative branch  republican  is going to fight to leverage power from the executive branch  democrat  by trying to get more conservatives into the judicial branch a democratcontrolled senate would do the same to a republican president if roles were flipped and rbg s spot became available 
rtitlegore
apparently  when bill clinton declared that  the era of big government is over   he failed to account for republicans regaining control of the executive branch 
that s good for bush right  government bureaucracy is good for our economy think of the new bureaucratic jobs that will become available when america s entire health care industry is absorbed by the federal government under president bernie sanders we are about to put george bush to shame as far as government growth is concerned 
thanks feeorg no better case for a third party in this country i was already voting no on the leftright 2016 
how does breaking up wall street banks affect my life  serious question not being disparaging 
it  might  also be reasonable to conclude that her not having been indicted is a sign she hasn't broken any laws  you know  if you're posting fox news and ny post articles in support of your cause  it might be time to evaluate your course 
jesus christ i can't think of a better thumbnail than that for this post he's like  i'm just saying you know 
it s a republic  not a democracy don't like it  get 60 votes in the senate for your team if you want to ram processes down the throat of the opposition party 
dont forget to thank gwb for the tsa and the rest of homeland security now can someone please refresh my memory  what was the last terrorist attack they prevented   crickets 
you know  if you're posting fox news and generating discussion and opinions based on faulty information 
i am learning so much about who i don't like on my own team this election season 
plus  society as a whole would be paying interest on the comment chain to the government distributed in a fund that pays for this to be wiped out by a crisis like 2008 
you know  if you're posting fox news and ny post really has it in for hillary 

you people are the worst get past her speaking circuit money talk about a more interesting nonissue like her terrible yellow coat 
gt  it's not just that the politician wants to act to curry the favor of the rich and powerful  more typically they identify with the interests of the rich and powerful so that they don't even see themselves as compromising a principle  gt  when we actually see money being handed over to politicians from the wealthy  whether in the form of large speaking fees or a highpaying job  it is probably best to think of it as analogous to a valentine present no one loves their spouse or significant other because of a generous valentine gift  rather it is a symbol of ongoing affection 
just another way of saying what bernie said in the last debate   i'm paraphrasing   i guess these banks just love to throw away money  right   it's obvious to anyone who will think about it  but plenty of people are invested in not thinking about it 

yeah  butbillwe love bill even if he's a rapscallion we loves us some bubba 
gt  bernie is a problem hillary can  t figure out how to solve  perhaps because he  s not the problem she is   damn  usa today tell us how you really feel   edit   kristen powers  the author of the article  was a member of the clinton organization near the beginning of her career she has since been firm in her support of universal health care and immigration reform  including a path to citizenship however  her stance on social policies are less obvious it's unclear who she supports it's only clear that she has a strong dislike for the clintons 
i really think it's time for the us to have more political parties it's pretty obvious that both republicans and dems are sick and tired of their own parties we got a guy who calls himself a socialist and a real estate tycoon reality show star as front runners time for a reality check 
president bush   america is under attack   http  images1browardpalmbeachcomimagermypetgoatisapparentlythauoriginal6438596bushgoatjpg  
what kind of article is this  why wouldn't gwb support jeb  they're brothers for fucks sake this isn't some big story that needs to be told 
 labels are for soup cans   dubya campaigning for jeb  see he still hasn't lost that idiot charm
i'm surprised they brought him out  who do they think he will appeal to  maybe they ll get neill to campaign too hope nobody asks him about samp  l
i am not which president in my lifetime has a anything but a disastrous legacy even obama isn't going to be remembered fondly for some of the actions of the us during his presidency  if anything he seemed to double down on everything bush did wrong
george w bush belongs in the hague  as do cheney and rumsfeld 
when bush  cheney  etc  are in jail for war crimes  then we can talk 
smartest thing he's ever said 
as someone who helps people sign up for the aca  50  of the callers i get can't afford the premiums even with a tax credit 20  can afford it with their tax credits i would say 10  have great prices and the rest are sent to medicaid or are eligible for exemptions obviously i know those numbers aren't extremely accurate but i'm just giving my input based off the calls i get 
what about the criticism that his healthcare plan has a   3 trillion hole   http  fiscalfactcheckcrfborganalysisofthesanderssinglepayeroffsets  according to the center for a responsible federal budget 
holy fuck  this place is just an extension of that sanders subreddit 
thank allah for donald trump 
the clintons scare the fuck out of me house of cards could be about them and not be too much different 
all i'm saying is if she wasn't a rich white woman  and was in fact a poor black young person she would have been shot twice and incarcerated for 2 years pending a trial right now 
of course a fucking frog would say something of this nature  just look at how great their socialist economy is doing  s
congress term limits add them pls 
how is this title allowed 

wait did fucken ben carson have a moment of lucidity and logic  something grounded in reality and an analysis of the situation argued from logos instead of ethos  holy fucken shit 
 i'm not a one issue candidate because we are not a one issue country  misses the mark money in politics is the issue how can you have an honest conversation about any other issue when special interest groups hold sway over the political system and people s interests  she's nibbling at the edges and bernie is going straight for the heart 
supplyside economics works  people  and by  works  i mean of course  it immediately runs your state over a cliff and into a deep ravine   kansas   280 million short  louisiana   940 million short  oklahoma   13   b   illion short
has trump called him a stupid poopyhead yet 
proud to be georgian today  edit  hahaha i have no idea why i'm being downvoted  must be the hillary brigade
if the late justice had died on january 15th of next year  ok  they might have a point at that point it's a week until inauguration  nothing s going to get done in that time  but it would be classy to consult with his successor to get the process started a week sooner  but cmon guysinauguration is 11 12 months away insisting on it now is just plain childish 
hillary essentially wants to maintain the status quo  which isn't exactly a great campaign slogan when so many people are alienated by the current political system 
polifact   bernie sanders is right  flint is a shithole  
a quote from the rubio ad  gt  today  more men and women are out of work than ever before in our nation  s history this is the bullshit that we should be focusing on  not which city s skyline is in the ad 
well canada is in america  along with mexico  all of the central american countries and of course south american countries 
do people actually care about stuff like this  who cares where the stock footage came from 
if only cruz had made this mistake 
i remember when it was morning in america when reagan first floated this turd of a slogan  say  how has that day gone  stagnant middle class wages  rampant deregulation that nearly wrecked our financial sector and not doing anything culturally cool like landing a man on the moon for the last 35 years because we're  taxed enough already  despite taxes being at 50 year lows 
heck yeah 
yeah my deductible for going to the er is insanely high so high i couldn't pay it anyway so no insurance is the real life reality
if you're a nonwhite american voter in nevada or south carolina  wouldn't you be a little angry to be regarded as part of a firewall  by this lady 
i live in marietta i just called senator fort s office to say  thank you  for his support of senator sanders 
wait what if seeing that congress refuses to work with our president he just says ok i am going to veto everything congress passes till i get my way 
watching hillary lose this election will be thoroughly satisfyingbut not as satisfying as watching her get arrested 
funny  if i was going to vote for a close family member to a former president i'd vote for michelle obama
random black person says they are voting for bernie  to the front page
as an asian american  i'm always a bit envious of minorities like blacks and hispanics who actually get touched upon in political campaigns and who people  journalists  activists  seem to always care about  the only asian firewall you ll hear of in the news is in china and its the technical usage of the term firewall 
i don't know why clinton and her campaign believes that the south is going to be a safe haven for her  you see  the thing about southern democrats is that they share alot of thoughts and feelings with southern republicans that live all around them  every day  for their entire lives  if you keep on hearing and seeing people talk about how much they hate hillary clinton as southern democrats do when they're around southern republicans  some of that will eventually seep in 
obama  you're fired 
it is his job to honor his constituents needs i applaud 
 let me insult a couple prominent members of the senate and then complain about it when they don't follow me along when i refuse to compromise 
man  both her and trump expect mexicans to build walls for them 
isn't saying  blacks are my firewall  or  latinos are my firewall  a bit weird   why did she start using that  firewall  phrase  
the only people using the term  firewall  are in the media  usually in a way that is negative towards hrc s campaign  and yet redditors jump on the  this is offensive  bandwagon lol  wtf 
why the fuck is everything a firewall these days  why did i never hear this term any other election cycle 
 removed 
yes  let's all vote for the old white career politician 
honestly  today i had a panic attack when it hit me  we've all been treating trump like an impossible side show candidate but dear god  he could actually do it the american people really are stupid enough that he could win and not only that the man is dangerous dangerous to world peace  dangerous to minorities  dangerous to human rights  i can't keep laughing about this 
i believe this will just help trump  it seems like he is the main target of obama 
so now hillary wants a wall 
what are important issues to latino community besides immigration reform  that s only thing i hear about
the way we keep using this  firewall  phrase  it sounds like she uses the bodies of the impoverished minorities to protect her fortune very disturbing image when you think about it 
wow that is really good
of course they are the reality is that the more latinos and blacks learn about sanders  the more likely they will vote for him the only hurdle for them is awareness sanders  policies will make their lives better  period clinton s policies will just be the same old dc bullshit would you choose a better life or a shit life 
i'm in las vegas and i'm switching from republican to democrat today so i can vote bernie on the 20th my family is probably gon na disown me but fuckem 
bernie is a wrecking ball to the clinton establishment
hillary s firewall is getting berned 
i int gon na lie to ya donald i was a leftie 

pobrecita 
good for him  but why is it front page news that a state senator flips  are we that desperate for positive bernie news that we ll upvote even a minor thing like this and proclaim it as the beginning of the end 
god the lack of good polls pisses me off  i have no idea how to feel about nevada 
booooooooooo facts 
all this is doing is encouraging simpleminded trump supporters to attack protestors in the hopes they ll get the opportunity to meet their phony hero i can't wait to watch trump get trounced in the general  fueled specifically by votes from the very people he denigrates 

it s almost like you can't get universal and meaningful coverage within a health system defined by forprofit insurance companies 
well  this is impossible  because i just read about 8000 comments in the other thread about superdelegates that said the never flip  etc s
the fucking do something about it https  enwikipediaorgwikibully_pulpit fuckkkkkkkkk 
 oh  no  my abuela  
protestors literally make trump stronger 
holy shit take that tobacco out of your mouth when you speak
er  does sanders not realize that state budgets in no way reflect federal budgets  state budgets do not cover wars  as that is federal military spending 
is president bernie going to be perpetually outraged at his own administration when things go wrong 
2016  0 1 6 
national polls don't matter if he can't close the gap with minorities  unfortunately 
wow  what he says is so true and spot on  part of me would take it further and start demanding prosecution of the people in power that made or allowed this to happen 
and none for kanye either all this money wasting overseas and nothing for our rappers back home 
infinite money for the f35 that will be rendered obsolete by the first dogfighting supersonic drone none for flint 
what a great endorsement for trump bush and now obama attacking him just cements him as antiestablishment 
gt  in response  aaron camp  a democratic blogger  wrote   for  mr clinton  to claim that we are all mixed race people    is dismissive of the serious problem of racism and racial inequality in this country  and  as a matter of fact  racist  valid point but i couldn't care less what a  blogger  has to say 
that made me smile 
i was genuinely moved by their words i hope the video goes viral so people can see the hope that trump inspires in his fellow americans 
reps are inna pickle  they either scorch earth obama s pick and bet they get the wh next year  or hedge and comprimise on a moderate obama may slip a more moderate person in if they hedge their bets  but where it's going either  next dem inserts way more liberal that obamas pick or  r  win the wh and can put a conservative judge in  but that is in turn  betting on trump s continued koolaid wallsmashing rise to the presidency  so i got ta ask em do you feel lucky 
uh other way around latinos are losing faith in hrc 
hillary won the popular vote 
everybody knows the best economies are ones where the people in government take our money  rake off vig for themselves and their patrons  then redirect it in ways they think are best krugman said it best  when we give the people in government  1 they will allocate it so efficiently that the we will see a  3 bang for that buck  but if you and i keep that dollar decide for ourselves how to use it way that meets our needs we will see only an   80 bang for the buck  at least that s what the people in government tell me  edit stupid new keyboard
the  mixed race  comment is odd but not completely out of line  notwithstanding the criticism of the random  democratic blogger  they quoted more damaging is probably his claim that hillary clinton is a  changemaker  who can get things done where president obama could not  for two primary reasons  1 anything that she can accomplish with an overwhelmingly republican congress will come at the expense of the voters she is courting in the democratic primary  2 it illustrates an undeserved smugness as well as disdain for president obama s accomplishments it also demonstrates that her attack on senator sanders for being insufficiently supportive of the president is disingenuous political theater 
this was the best moment of the entire rally  trump has so much respect for the people of this country  and it really shows i'm so proud to have this man running for president 
get a load of all the credulous rubes in this thread whoo boy 

i bet even with all these downplaying  they will still be surprised with the result  i see sanders leading nv by 912   yes it's my bold prediction 
it just shows the panic in the hillary campaign 
uh  why is this  sorry hillary   the conventional wisdom is that sanders has a more narrow support base  right

man  that site really shat up my browser  afraid i was unable to read the article 
i think it's a little too early to say it's a failed strategy 
gt   clinton  may be obama  s heir  but sanders is fdr  s i really like this line succint case of traditional liberalism vs neoliberalism 
has she really failed though  she's beating bernie sanders and has a lot more money  political endorsements  and is ahead on delegates  even though bernie won nh she got the same amount   if anything i'd say what hilary is doing is working 
sanders need to show his birth certificate
it feels like a lot of people on this thread think the entire world uses reddit and thus hate clintonsupport sanders young people are notorious for not voting because they rather make memes and facebook posts about who they think should be potus and call it a day

in truth  this was a device he used to find some kind of common ground between the two countries he wasn't seriously considering an alien invasion he and gorbachev couldn't agree on any scenario in which the us and ussr would change the adversarial nature of their relationship  so he came up with a scenario as a means of getting both men to think differently 
one of the first things clinton done when he became president was to check and see if aliens were real and covered up he obviously didn't find anything but there is even some stuff the president can't get access to because he doesn't know where to look or the records have not been  updated  yet private contractors sometimes known more than potus do know this  if you have the technology to travel across the universe in a timely manner  than you have more than enough technology to cloak us from you you sugar water loven advanced hairless apes remember we are among you always

yeah  tons of people in this state that are outside of the larger cities get very backwards in their voting alabama has some fun stuff going on with our politics one thing that is fun is that we operate under the home rule doctrine  which means anything that a county wants to do is required to go on a state wide ballot mobile wants to add some tax having to do with hurricane disaster stuff  everyone in the state votes on this  from mobile all the way up to birmingham also we don't rewrite anything if i recall correctly we have the largestlongest state constitution in the country alabama  rather than removing anything basically keeps all of our laws as a running total and in the bottom of every bill or amendment that passes is  anything that previously conflicts with this is now considered repealed and invalid   so we just keep tacking stuff on the end and never really remove anything at all  so we still have a lot of fun stuff on the books from years back 
the fact that the state waited til then doesn't really matter as the federal gov ruled that type of discrimination illegal with loving v va in the late 60s 
i wonder how common it is to repealoverturn laws that the supreme court has already declared unconstitutional  as the interracial marriage ban was 3 decades before this law was overturned in alabama   i understand the symbolic value of repealing such a law  and the troublesome matter that 40  voted against it   but in for all practical purposes  the law being on the books has no tangible impact 
i never knew those guys were racists  never really liked their music anyway

 officially but ebony has been mixing with ivory in alabama for decades someone probably just happened to notice that the law had never been officially rescinded and then did so publicly for pc brownie points because everyone knows the only way to teach society to forget about race and move forward is to constantly call attention to it in a public manner every chance you get s
eli5  i always hear on reddit about the gloriousness of the tough finns  but my wikipedia perusings indicate that they lost the winter war and were forced to give up a small amount of valuable land worth 13 of their economy what am i missing 
this type of improvised incendiary weapon was such an important tool for the finnish resistance that they actually mass produced them in a factory  after impacting and igniting a tank  the oil used in production of the tank to protect it from rust would ignite also  turning the tank into a dutch oven  and often causing it to explode quite an effective weapon against an imposing enemy  if you can get close enough  gt  against attacking soviet tanks  the finns were using incendiary devices consisting of bottles of ethanol  tar  and gasoline with a simple burning rag for a fuse these were improved by using longburning storm matches attached to the bottle s side  gt   these molotov cocktails   http  culinarylorewdfilescomlocalfilesfoodhistory  3ahowdidthemolotovcocktailgetitsnamefinnishmolotovcocktailjpg  were actually massproduced by the finnish alcohol monopoly alko  gt  the finns  of course  did not invent the idea of device  they only gave it a name that has stuck to this day such devices had been used many other times throughout history  and the chinese had employed molotov cocktails against japanese tanks in 1937   culinary lore   http  wwwculinarylorecomfoodhistory  howdidthemolotovcocktailgetitsname   a nontraditional source for the history of weapons but a good source all the same

dude that s a cool story 
gt  the name  molotov cocktail  was coined by the finns during the winter war  1  the name is an insulting reference to soviet foreign minister vyacheslav molotov  who was responsible for the setting of  spheres of interest  in eastern europe under the molotov  ribbentrop pact in august 1939 the pact with the nazis bearing molotov s name was widely mocked by the finns  as was much of the propaganda molotov produced to accompany the pact  including his declaration on soviet state radio that bombing missions over finland were actually airborne humanitarian food deliveries for their starving neighbours the finns sarcastically dubbed the soviet cluster bombs  molotov bread baskets  in reference to molotov s propaganda broadcasts  2  when the handheld bottle firebomb was developed to attack soviet tanks  the finns called it the  molotov cocktail   as  a drink to go with the food    3  molotov himself despised the name  particularly as the term became ubiquitous  4

again  in high school extra points is not that unusual  but the numbers are in your coach s favor 
i graduated from pa and can provide some insight into coach kelly s strategy he never kicks field goals  always goes for 2 his thinking is most defenses don't practice blocking against a team that goes for 2 every time also  he doesn't want to put all his trust into one player  kicker  for that one extra point when he can put the ball in the qbs hands and have multiple options for 2 points  qb sneak  running back  wrs  etc  he also onside kicks every time  again because most teams don't practice recovering onside kicks and his teams practices like crazy lastly  he does not field punts he lets them kick it as deep as they want and he just takes the ball from wherever they down it his thinking there is that a lot can go wrong when fielding a punt and give the other team the chance to recover a dropped ball or something similar he's has gotten a ton of grief here in the state for his antics  but it has paid off and he is highly regarded by pa students and alumni just thought i'd throw out some info  edit  i meant punt  not kickoff calm yourselves 
yeah  coached my kid s youth football team for years we always did this lots of upside  very little downside  with little guys  it's hard to cover a proper kickoff well if your kicker is any good but they ll go get an onside kick like nobody s business 
well i can tell ya if you are at your own 20 yard line you might want to consider punting 

i don't think this strategy would work past the hs level

it would be interesting to wake up in the middle of the night and go outside  and find jupiter is filling the whole sky the cosmic vacuum cleaner has come for us  i wonder what it would be like at that point to ride it into the gas giant  rwritingprompts  you want to do this one  and you know that when people wake up and see what s going on  they're still going to raid the stores for milk and bread 
does that mean the grs is the power indicator

worth noting  she died in 1907  long before stalin s rise to power and subsequent crimes against humanity  also worth noting  he married again 12 years later  to nadezhda alliluyeva  who was rumored to be bipolar and killed herself in 1932

gt   russia  s information war might be thought of as the biggest trolling operation in history  and its target is nothing less than the utility of the internet as a democratic space in the midst of such a war  the runet  as the russian internet is often called  can be an unpleasant place for anyone caught in the crossfire soon after i met leonid volkov  he wrote a post on his facebook wall about our interview  saying that he had spoken with someone from the new york times a former prokremlin blogger later warned me about this kremlin allies  he explained  monitored volkov  s page  and now they would be on guard  that was not smart   he said

jupiter is my homeboy
i saw a special once that said jupiter was just a bit too small to become a star if its absorbing all this mass  could its gravity increase to the point it ignites and becomes a star 
this is the conventional theory but is not entirely true jupiter is still believed to be a protector in terms of long period  comets   but not asteroids in general the idea in your title largely stems from theorizations and computer simulations done in 1994 and earlier it was a ground breaking study but was done on inferior computing power with large approximations  for near orbit asteroids such as ones in the asteroid belt  more recent studies show that jupiter s gravity causes asteroid collisions  disrupting their orbit and sending more asteroids insystem towards earth  so  while it probably was helpful after the heavy bombardment period and the formation of our planet  the gas giants are believed to have caused the late heavy bombardment   and helps stave off longperiod comets  it is fond of throwing bits from the asteroid belt at us  wikipedia doesn't even give a citation for the last part of the title   here is a source   http  wwwspacecom14919jupitercometimpactsearthhtml

the best of bowie  disc is pretty damn solid and so is ziggy stardust  plenty of good stuff on all the rest too even if nobody bought the later stuff  yes  a big part of his influence was his persona but i would not say he was overrated
nobody would care if he were still alive 
that s probably because david bowie isn't that good like the beatles  he received undue attention due to his whiteness and marketing savvy

played a game in high school where my coach had me line drive every kickoff directly at one of their frontline guys first kick i nailed the kid straight in the helmet and the ball came right back to my teammates if you have a decent kicker you can get away with some tricky stuff in high school football 
can somebody elinff  explain like i'm not a football fan   so if they get to 4th down and they don't think they can get a 1st down they don't kick shorter rather than trying to kick longer and possibly through the uprights

high school football games are almost always decided by which team has the best athlete this player usually plays all the positions that have high impact and many touches on both sides of the ball  qbrb  cb  lb  this means they usually also return kicks  this strategy is great because it limits the touches the other team s best player gets over the course of the game

scientology is not a religion it is  at best  a business what it actually is is a criminal organization there are two kinds of scientologists  the misinformed and the crooks the first need to be saved from the latter the whole organisation needs to be forbidden it is not a religion 
so if i am the coach playing against this guy and he's about to onside kick to my guyscan i tell my guys to form up together at the front and not have anyone back to  recieve  a ball that isn't coming   in other words  can i put my entire team in the mix instead of just 34 players that would normally be there 
this is an interesting point  it's similar to how english makes a distinction between light red and dark red   pink  and  red  respectively  while many other languages don't russian makes a distinction between light blue and dark blue  but we just call them  blue   so it isn't that japanese didn't have a word for green although this is partially true it's that they literally didn't acknowledge  green  as its own color  that said this is an interesting fact

cool
the problem is that the energy of geothermal is where people are not and getting that power to where the people are makes it both not cost effective and impracticable
this is a great holdover but i think there was a joke 
hmm  should we still huge holes or use solar panels and wind farms 
i went to staufen germany before and after their geothermal project caused building damage i'd say it's not practical maybe in the desert
that is interesting and a huge relief to know do you have an address i can mail a thank you card to jupiter for protecting us inner planets

i can't help but imagine this as a power play by jack donaghy 

so  in other words  it wasn't ryan reynolds who chose to play deadpool in the movies  it was deadpool who chose ryan 
i have a sharpei that i love  and i really like reynolds  so i guess i got ta hurry and go watch it already 
was that said before he was   deadpool   in that shitty xmen movie 

and christ also wasn't part of his name christ is a greek translation of mashiach  meaning messiah so  really  one could argue  he should be call yeshua the messiah  not jesus christ 
jesus is the latinized version of yeshua  which is joshua  meaning  god is salvationyahweh is salvation 
to summarize  here is the actual full path the name took  yeshua  translated to joshua elsewhere  hebrew name  yesu  short form of the same name  like josh  iesu  same name transliterated into the greek language iesus  male names in greek need to end in  s  jesus  adapted to use j instead of i in other words  jesus  real name was joshua    but that s not the most interesting part   joshua was actually a fairly popularcommon name among the jews  think mohammed among muslims   in order to distinguish one joshua from another  they might adopt various honorifics like  son of ____  after their name for example  simon barjonas is actually simon  son of jonas  bar  hebrew for  son of   jesus was known by many honorifics in his time  but one of them was son of the father father in hebrew is  abba  so joshua  son of the father would be joshua barabbas  now when pilate wanted to release jesus because he thought he was innocent  he set him up before the crowd opposite a known criminalterrorist that man s name    albert einstein   joshua barabbas  in other words  pilate hoped to perform a bait and switch by presenting the guy he wanted to release with a criminal known by the exact same name  http  wwwhebrewstreamsorgworksntstudiesyeshuabarabbahtml
yeah  that s the part that s unbelievable 
just about any modern name for him is a translation iesus is a roman translationthe i for j swap was a thing in the vulgate translation probably the name today that would sound most similar to how he was addressed back then is yeshua  but even that isn't exact it's definitely spelled differently in aramaic than in english i mean  they were'nt even using our alphabet this is a people speaking approximately 2000 years ago in a different language that relies on very different sound patterns than english nothing that we say or spell is going to sound perfectly like what people in that era called him  but jesus  or yeshuajoshua  is basically a rough  closeenough translation 
how are the old testament j names explained  ie jacob
i learned this from indiana jones and the last crusade 
how can asteroids impact  gas giants  is the gravity within strong enough to keep them 
his real name as yeshua jesus is the latin translation 
 for op   https  youtubebcjiestfvoc  
its a translation all the names in the bible are romanisations 
it didn't say inri on all the crosses i saw at church for nothing  i  sus nazar  nus  r  x i  dae  rum   https  enwikipediaorgwikijesus_king_of_the_jews  even the word jew wasn't pronounced with a  j

so  stupid people 
from  the source   http  screenrantcomryanreynoldsdiscussesdeadpoolcharacterspinoffrob6127  that wikipedia cites  gt   ya  i love the character i  ve always loved the character i remember reading one of the deadpool comic books  and somebody asked deadpool what he looks like and he said he looks like a cross between a sharpei and ryan reynolds and i was like  i really  really wan na play this guy at some point i thought it was pretty cool it  s a guy that knows he  s in a comic book how hard is it to shoot that properly  that  s not something they put in wolverine nor would it belong in that universe  the comic itself is  cable and deadpool no 2  which was published in 2004 
does cable make an appearance in the movie  cable and dead pool was my favorite series i'd be pleasantly surprised if he was or if there were  plans  for the future

so  largest by square footage  weight or volume  because that quaken aspen is suppose to cover 106 acres  so less square footage  but weights 6000 tonnes each trunk can be up too 100ft tall someone would have to do the math  i don't know how thick the fungus is  but is seems the tree stand wins in weight and maybe total volume

gt  farm owners and residents who live on the property told a dallasft worth nbc station that the real reason for the law enforcement exercise appears to have been code enforcement  gt  local authorities had cited the garden of eden in recent weeks for code violations  including  grass that was too tall  bushes growing too close to the street  a couch and piano in the yard  chopped wood that was not properly stacked  a piece of siding that was missing from the side of the house  and generally unclean premises   smith s statement said she said the police didn't produce a warrant until two hours after the raid began  and officers shielded their name tags so they couldn't be identified  that s fucked 
the problem is generally called  overcriminalization  whereby police are using incredible amounts of resources and force on extremely marginal violations of the law  policy organizations from all over the political spectrum have written to condemn overcriminalization  http  wwwheritageorgissueslegalovercriminalization http  wwwbrookingsedublogsfixgovposts20151222mensreareformvillasenor https  wwwacluorgblogspeakeasycriminalcodesgonewild
gt   grass that was too tall  bushes growing too close to the street  a couch and piano in the yard  chopped wood that was not properly stacked  a piece of siding that was missing from the side of the house  and generally unclean premises   in other words  the city is trying to make up excuses for using a swat team that fucked up and didn't find any drugs 
noknock raids are scary as hell as a prospect 
murican police state at its finest 
i live up the street from where this happened it actually happened just outside of arlington  but in a small enough township that they contract with the city for police services  hence arlington pd action  the issue wasn't weed the issue was that they were violating city ordinance by keeping old junk on the property and growing food without farming licenses several adjacent property owners had complained that it devalued their property  that the junk  which they recycled into useful things in the spirit of self sustainability  were harboring pests like rats and mosquito s  which im sure it was  the city had been sending notices and fining the property owners of the organic commune for quite some time for violations  but they really were looking for an angle to shut the whole thing down so  someone  reported a grow op there  believable if you know anyone that lived there  which i do  and a judge issued a raid warrant for it  of course  a warrant for weed doesn't give them the right to use okra and tomatoes as evidence in a case  but it does give them the right to seize anything in the process of a search it was extremely dirty and not handled correctly by the city and arlington pd they lost a lot of support by the people around here because of it  i personally understand the gripes of the adjacent property owners  and i don't think the owners of the commune property were very considerate of their neighbors  essentially ignoring them with  its my land  freedom  evil corporations lobby to make it illegal for me to grow my own food  and all of that  when it wasn't about anything like that but the way the city handled things had a lot to be desired to say the very least 
when you are looking to start your own property and do things your own way  you have to appreciate the invasive nature of law enforcement and the stretching idea of plain view it's why so many property owners essentially build moats around their properties where they dig down about four or five feet and make it about six feet wide and will sometimes add a fence to the outside of it if your neighbors who have a house a quarter of a mile from your property line can see onto your property and find the state you keep it in distasteful  they can get code enforcement involved if they are annoying enough  if they can't see your property  the rare neighbor will trespass and then cry to the cops when your dogs chase them off or they cut themselves on the barbed wire you have on the top of the fence  when i went in on a property as part of a trust the first thing we made sure of  was that there were no neighbors it won't stop the cops from executing a warrant  but it makes it far harder to get a warrant and just because you aren't breaking the law doesn't mean cops won't bust in and look for things to arrest you for or that there is no chance they won't plant drugs  government really doesn't like people deviating from the accepted norm of being plebes 

i love how all high school football content just uses that explosions in the sky  style music now

how on earth did they seize blackberry bushes without dying  we can't even trim the demonbushes of death in our yard without massive injury 

as a kid i always thought it was wordplay about his grungy tavern ie  moe s is slack 
i can't find the video but there was a community that met up privately to get raw cow milk and they were swatted and held at gun point and told to pour all the milk out 
i get that they were looking for marijuana  but when they found none why did they seize all the other plants  could they not identify marijuana plants   take anything green  the boys at the lab will sort it later  
so we are calling swat to tell people to cut their grass and clean up their property  this country continues to amaze me 
is this state sponsored terrorism 
the finnish side of my family lived in suomussalmi and my grandfather was one of those crazy bastards that burned down his home just to mess with the russians during the initial attack he later built it all up again  just to loose the barn and most of the animals in a fire a couple years later  and once again built it up the finns were poor bastards back then  and they fought for what little they had he died in the early 60 s when my dad was just a kid so i never got to meet him i have one of his medals from the war  and whenever i feel that life is unfair  i think about what they went through he rebuilt his home 2 times in 10 years  and raised 8 kids with barely any money hard motherfuckers  finns back then

who the fuck tattoos a baby what an asshole

so back in the day i worked at the university of minnesota hospital two of these girls  nicole and erica i think  were nursing assistants there at the time they were without a doubt the hottest girls there and that is saying something about a hospital full of college age workers  one day a buddy of mine tells me there are three of them he saw them eating in the cafeteria i called total bullshit on him and then magically a few months later all three were in playboy  so  you know  he was right  this story had no point but there it is

some states have banned sex toys instead  shops sell  novelty cake toppers  or something similar the thing is  it still may be shaped like a cock  but since they're selling it as a novelty it gets around both any law banning dildos as well as any regulation against unsafe sex toys

kind of reminds me how in texas the sellers of sex shops must ask if you're buying the toys for educational purposes no more than 3 sex toys are allowed in a residential home  and sodomy is still illegal are these laws still enforced 
good guy jupiter
i worked on this study as part of the egs team the subtext here is that most of that energy would be incredibly expensive to produce  many times the current cost of energy   while geothermal energy technically exists everywhere in massive quantities  the costbenefit analysis  which is another big part of this study  suggests that the technology to make tapping this energy feasible is about 50 years out 
that s how they power all their synths

it s a pretty daunting example of how bad things can get without proper resource management there are several major rivers in the world that rarely even reach the ocean  the yellow river and the colorado river being notable examples the southern portion of the aral sea is all but doomed  its fate sealed by the damming of its northern portion  which  if there is a silver lining  is recovering  and its fish population returning the salinity in what is left of the southern portion makes it inhospitable for the species that once thrived there

various types of pizza had existed in the us for 50 years or so before these troops returned home with an appetite for tomato pie few people ate it other than italian immigrants and their families the troops who had stayed in italy  though  had eaten as much of it as they could get while they were there  and came home looking for more  americans put quite a spin on the traditional idea of a pizza new styles like chicago deep dish grew rapidly in popularity  popularized as an italian dish eventually  these new pies made their way back to italy  where it was adopted as a native  dish  this archetype of the transference of ideas like food staples is an important concept in social studies and anthropology  where it's appropriately known as   the pizza effect   https  enwikipediaorgwikipizza_effect   it is used to help track and understand the flow of information and ideas across cultures in addition  it is not a onetimeonly deal  the effect is a cycle  gt  stephen jenkins noted that the feedback phenomenon could continue  in the case of pizza  he wrote that the return of pizza to italy again influenced american cuisine  gt   pizzaloving american tourists  going to italy in the millions  sought out authentic italian pizza italians  responding to this demand  developed pizzerias to meet american expectations delighted with their discovery of  authentic  italian pizza  americans subsequently developed chains of  authentic  italian brickoven pizzerias  gt   hence  americans met their own reflection in the other and were delighted 
my dad  born in 1943  grew up on a very rural farm  no running water like you do he only ever ate at home  home cooked food they grew or hunted  his dad had pizza once and hated it  never tried it again my dad wanted to see what the hype was all about  the first time he had pizza he was  14 and spent a good chunk his savings which was a lot of money for his family and went into town bought an entire pizza he ate the entire thing and 30 mins later he was sick as all get out and ended up throwing it all up  he went back to the pizza shop and ordered another  kept that one down and loved pizza ever since  my love for pizza is much less story worthy  tmnt all the way

on a similar note  american soldiers stationed in italy needed coffee  but most couldn't stand the taste of espresso  which is how nearly all coffee in italy is served   in an attempt to create something more similar to the dripstyle brew they were accustomed to  they started diluting the espresso with hot water  thus  the americano was born

3000 children is over 2000 years of pregnancy wow 

that s fantastic  but what the hell was then done with the kids  i feel like someone would notice 3000 babies bouncing around 
tragically  of the 3000 she delivered  some 2500 newborns perished a few hundred others with blue eyes were sent away to be germanized 
i am half polish  mom s side  and catholic people like her not only make me proud of my heritage and faith  but give me resolve to be a better person i can complain that it's too cold  or that i hate preparing my taxes  or whatever  and then remember people have it worse and ask what i can do  since even in the middle of a concentration camp  this woman managed to make a difference  especially for the children who survived 
til people were still gettin  it on despite being in a death camp never has there been a more powerful testament to the enduring power of the human spirit 
and then they all died
it s not in that wikipedia article but i am sure i remember reading  probably at auschwitz  that all the babies that were born there were given a small secret tattoo under their arm so they could be traced after the war  i can't seem to find anything on google but i am sure i read that somewhere 
my family is related to her husband  and thus her kids if anyone has any links or stories about any of them let me know  thank you for sharing op 
not to be morbid but this  was  the nazis  why didn't they just kill her and find another midwife who would do this  i have to believe there was a plural number of midwives being imprisoned  and that some of them were either less ethical or less strong in their convictions  note  it's of course amazing that she was able to perform this work and save many lives  but there s a piece of the puzzle missing here that s all i'm saying  edit  oh the nazis didn't realize what was going on  because a large majority of the newborns were being killed by others anyway that is depressing  but answers the question  
3000 children is over 2000 years of pregnancy wow 
 euthanize   i think you mean  kill  
sainthood  what miracle did she perform  sainthood  didn't the catholic church kinda ignore the whole holocaust until they no longer couldn't because of political correctness

this death is a tragedy  and the fact it wasn't properly investigated is a shame the police have  intentionally or through idiocy  botched numerous parts of standard procedure in the event of a gun death  for example  they never processed gun residue swabs taken from the deceased of the owner of the gun  his father  the article is full of other examples additionally  there should be some culpability for the fact his dad was preventing him from taking lexapro  an antidepressant kyle was prescribed his father didn't want him taking it because scientology  gt  the visit ended in disaster after three weeks when tom brennan vehemently attacked his son s desire to continue to go to college  with tom saying that scientology was all he  kyle brennan  needed to succeed in life  gt  kyle fought back saying     only an idiot would believe anything l ron hubbard has to say    this kid clearly had a good head on his shoulders his father s wife referred to him as an   enemy of the church   http  wwwlultimaribattutait38356_scientologylemortisospettekylebrennan    so obviously he was doing something right  he deserved better unfortunately  the long arm of scientology s legal division managed to obfuscate the investigation every step of the way his mother  victoria  is still fighting for answers 
nothing to see here i'll sue your ass  and  your balls
that sounds like a miscavige of justice to me 
scientology killed this boy we need to outlaw this evil corporation
thats what you get for calling xemuxenu a faggot  edit  z to x
is it even possible to take down the scienctology cult  i feel like their to ingrained into the upper ecelon their nigh untouchable unless we get someone in power willing to take them on and even then that person would probably kill himself by driving a semi into the front of his house while he is sleeping upstairs
dont they have a home base or something  why hasn't anyone tried to attack them or bomb their building if they are this terrible 
so arrest him  arrest miscavige s sister run them through court and jdam the church of scientology ezpz 
scientology is not a religion it is  at best  a business what it actually is is a criminal organization there are two kinds of scientologists  the misinformed and the crooks the first need to be saved from the latter the whole organisation needs to be forbidden it is not a religion 
from the court point of view all you can say is the death was not the result of a suicide there s not strong enough evidence to indite scientology or the father

it s almost like the grammys don't really mean anything 
people read way too much into major awards it's all either decided by a bunch of old people completely out of touch anything modern or voted on by little kids for viewers choice awards even nobel doesn't deserve respect anymore after giving obama a prize for doing nothing but become president 
the grammys are a joke 
that helps proves that grammy s are bs 
you know i  actually  grew up on bowie and almost  all  of these comments make me cringe but the comments bitching about how he is overrated are far more cringeworthy than the people jumping on the bandwagon 
why the fuck are all these artists coming out saying how much they loved bowie  he was good but your favorite artist  really  he didn't get a number 1 album until he died  then everyone jumped on the bowie train seriously  stop fluffing your own profile by saying you loved a former mega pop star 
but he won my approval and that s all that matters 
i d see a movie cause it won an oscar i'd see a play if it won a tony i'd read a book if it won a national book award  if an album has won a grammy my instinct tells me that it is a shitty piece of popular garbage with no merit 
the grammys are for pop garbage which ever producer has the best hookers and blow and pays the most money gets their shitty album to win thats how it works it has nothing to do with artistic value or skill 
i honestly don't know one of his songs off the top of my head 
nobody would care if he were still alive 
the best of bowie  disc is pretty damn solid and so is ziggy stardust  plenty of good stuff on all the rest too even if nobody bought the later stuff  yes  a big part of his influence was his persona but i would not say he was overrated
he's better known for being weird and his snl shows 
you don't need a grammy to be recognized as awesome 
who gives a shit 
finally i've been saying all this shit since his death bowie wasn't anything special other than being androgynous
doest matter to me most of that crap is not goven to the bedt musician anyway 
and yet the grammys paid tribute to him through bad lady gaga karaoke and an intel commercial 
that s probably because david bowie isn't that good like the beatles  he received undue attention due to his whiteness and marketing savvy 
good i always thought his music was terrible 

i ll bet it runs on government money and donations  and that those who run it take their cut  probably over fifty percent  for  expenses   this is a business  people stop being such chumps 
she seems well deserved of a sainthood or similar  what did the catholic church do against the nazis  i've heard nothing except for the jokes eddie izzard tells about hitler and the pope  and god   does anyone got any good links about this 
it took a second read before i realized she herself did not give birth to 3000 kids 
technically  hitler wasn't excommunicated by the church  because the pope at the time shared his views   since any catholic who dies is presumed to go to heaven  does that make hitler a saint

 from the article    in 1998 a team from the us forest service set out to investigate the cause of large tree dieoffs in the malheur national forest in east oregon  they identified affected areas in aerial photographs and collected root samples from 112 dead and dying trees  mostly firs tests showed all but four of the trees had been infected with the honey fungus armillaria solidipes  previously known as armillaria ostoyae   when mycelia from genetically identical a solidipes meet  they can fuse to form one individual the researchers harnessed this ability  growing fungi samples in pairs in petri dishes by observing which ones fused and which ones rejected each other  they found that 61 of the trees had been struck down by the same clonal colony  individuals with identical genetic makeup that all originated from one organism  the most widelyspaced were 24 miles  38 km  apart the team calculated that the a solidipes covered an area of 37 sq miles  96 sq km   and was somewhere between 1900 and 8650 years old  at the time  the largest known organism was a fungus of the same species discovered in 1992 in southwest washington  which stretches over 25 sq miles  65 sq km   biologists have long debated what constitutes an individual organism the recordbreaking a solidipes clonal colony passes the test based on a definition of being made up of genetically identical cells that can communicate  and that have a common purpose or can at least coordinate themselves

david bowie was good  but his music is not best in popularity i personally wouldn't have voted him to win any of the awards written by op either  just cause david bowie is dead now  doesn't mean he was the best artist ever that didn't win a grammy most people didn't even give a shit about him until he died  fact 
all three gave birth to baby girls about a month apart weird  also  all three had a second child that was a boy

here s the specific segment   initially  it was feared that the lightning strike could have caused the command module s  cm  parachute mechanism to prematurely fire  disabling the explosive bolts that open the parachute compartment to deploy them if they were indeed disabled  the command module would have crashed uncontrollably into the pacific ocean and killed the crew instantly since there was no way to figure out whether or not this was the case  ground controllers decided not to tell the astronauts about the possibility the parachutes deployed and functioned normally at the end of the mission 
that s because those ceremonies are shit shows also  ucablebent1988 i didn't just jump on the bandwagon i've been listening to david bowie my whole life and yes he is one of my favorite musicians out there  born 1973 

it s kinda sad that they went on playboy as a suggestion from their dad  and the only thing under personal  life is that they've had babies 

but surely the potentially stolen merchandise would have been destroyed in the fire anyway  this is an unbelievably sad and pointless waste of life

2 other facts about this song  the studio caught on fire a week or two into the recording causing the band to have to rerecord the entire song  ironic since the devil is usually symbolized by fire  it is also the last song to feature their founding member brian jones he plays the hand drums and does some of the woo woo s  he died either before it was released or shortly after

when i was in college and my little brother was like 1617  he was mixed up with the wrong crowd at school  and started smoking weed and skipping school  apparently one of our neighbors saw him one day  when he was supposed to be in school  come out of the house and exchange money or something with one of his bad friends who drove by we live in a mostly white  uppermiddle class neighborhood  fast forward a few weeks later and i am at work and i get a call that there s a swat truck at my house and our whole street is crawling with police  a judge had apparently signed search warrant based on the reports of some nosycrappy neighbor  who instead of letting us know what my brother was up to  decided to just report my brother to the police  it felt like the cops somehow got the impression that they would find pablo escobar s cousin s operation in our house or something  we're originally from colombia  but have been living in the usa for almost 20 years   cuz the amount of excessive force they brought was ridiculous  they basically blew away our front door  and kicked in every door that was closed  even the unlocked interior doors  if it was closed  they knocked it down   they emptied out  everything  in every single room  closet  etc it was a mess i was surprised they didn't tear down the drywall  what did they find  a jar with  weed residue   according to them  in my brothers room and some old pain pills from when my other brother broke his ankle in 3 places playing soccer the previous year  the house was mostly empty   thank goodness  except for an aunt who was living in our basement at the time i got the call at work and got home asap when i got home  the cops started interrogating me  and then when my little brother got home the cops started recording my brother on video and trying to get him  to confess  about what they had found thankfully he didn't say anything stupid and i kept telling him to wait for my mother to get home before saying anything  after my mother got home  they simple showed her the warrant  and packed up and left neither my brother nor anyone at my house was ever arrested or indicted for anything from this search warrant and from that day onwards we lost all trust whatsoever in the local police

gt  weismann conducted the experiment of removing the tails of 68 white mice  repeatedly over 5 generations  and reporting that no mice were born in consequence without a tail or even with a shorter tail he stated that  901 young were produced by five generations of artificially mutilated parents  and yet there was not a single example of a rudimentary tail or of any other abnormality in this organ   10  weismann was aware of the limitations of this experiment  and made it clear that he embarked on the experiment precisely because  at the time  there were many claims of animals inheriting mutilations  he refers to a claim regarding a cat that had lost its tail having numerous tailless offspring   there were also claims of jews born without foreskins none of these claims  he said  were backed up by reliable evidence that the parent had in fact been mutilated  leaving the perfectly plausible possibility that the modified offspring were the result of a mutated gene the purpose of his experiment was to lay the claims of inherited mutilation to rest the results were consistent with weismann s germ plasm theory
